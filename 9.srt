I saw something in the three of you.

00:00:22,493 --> 00:00:23,381
Are you serious?

7
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:26,528
Your Everest is right in front of you, Moo.

8
00:00:26,528 --> 00:00:27,804
Reach the summit.

9
00:00:27,923 --> 00:00:29,875
I just finished writing this song last night.

10
00:00:29,875 --> 00:00:31,078
I want you to be the first to hear it.

11
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:33,108
Thank you for writing this song for me.

12
00:00:34,489 --> 00:00:35,437
I passed, Kang.

13
00:00:35,627 --> 00:00:37,160
Well done.

Can I get a graduation gift?

18
00:00:44,752 --> 00:00:46,658
Even if you didn’t ask, I’d give it anyway.

19
00:00:54,086 --> 00:00:55,169
Are you okay?

20
00:00:56,121 --> 00:00:56,913
Yes, I am.

21
00:00:57,294 --> 00:00:58,219
I’m very okay.

22
00:00:58,743 --> 00:01:00,675
Are you okay?

23
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:02,013
I’m okay.

24
00:01:02,418 --> 00:01:03,145
So,

25

what are you going to do next?

26
00:01:07,382 --> 00:01:10,408
Work and save money to marry you.

I mean your plan right after graduation.

29
00:01:13,456 --> 00:01:14,492
You’re thinking too far.

30
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,092
Your question wasn’t clear.

31
00:01:16,568 --> 00:01:18,906
Honestly, I don’t have any plans.

32
00:01:18,906 --> 00:01:22,625
I’m just going to go to university and train at the company.

I don’t know.

37
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,462
When do you report to the university?

38
00:01:30,462 --> 00:01:31,094
I didn’t do anything wrong.

39
00:01:31,094 --> 00:01:31,892
Have you bought the textbooks?

40
00:01:31,892 --> 00:01:32,464
I didn’t read the details.

41
00:01:32,464 --> 00:01:33,053
I’m leaving.

42

43
00:01:34,111 --> 00:01:35,330
I don’t know anything.

44
00:01:35,330 --> 00:01:36,842
I don’t want to say wrong information and embarrass myself.

45
00:01:37,271 --> 00:01:38,985
I asked because I’m concerned.

46
00:01:38,985 --> 00:01:40,964
You already graduated high school, but you don’t know anything.

47
00:01:41,892 --> 00:01:42,966
Don’t be harsh on me

48
00:01:43,228 --> 00:01:46,894
If you’re going to be, why don’t you become my personal manager?

49
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,463
So you can manage everything about me.

50
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:50,773
Do you have money?

51
00:01:50,868 --> 00:01:51,473
I charge an expensive fee.

52
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:53,840
Despite how I look, I’m rich.

53

Stop it.

54
00:01:59,599 --> 00:02:01,190
I knew since I became your boyfriend

55

that I’d have to take care of you.

What prank are you pulling, Yos?

63
00:03:57,517 --> 00:03:58,889
Did you get the bad influence from me?

64

You shocked me.

65

I’m not joking.

66

67

I don’t know.

69
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:15,834
Since a long time ago.

70
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:20,113
I’m not sure if it started in junior high or high school.

71
00:04:21,518 --> 00:04:22,897
Before I knew it,

72
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:25,396

You don’t have to feel the same way about me.

Damn it! I shouldn’t have done it!

93

Bro and I have sorted things out about you.

128

But, bro, you had quite the nerve.

129
00:07:48,036 --> 00:07:51,007
You used work as an excuse when you were actually trying to get close to Kang.

130

What are you talking about?

131

Back then, he didn’t know I was hitting on you.

132

But when he found out, he understood

133
00:07:58,258 --> 00:08:00,024
and supported me to pursue you.

134

Kang, isn’t it?

154
00:08:47,620 --> 00:08:48,334
Yes.

155
00:08:49,001 --> 00:08:50,663
Kang has three roles:

156
00:08:50,663 --> 00:08:55,582
being my manager, my private chef, and my boyfriend.

157
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:56,431
Right.

158
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,787
You sure don’t hold back on that introduction, huh?

159
00:08:58,882 --> 00:09:00,158
I’ve seen him before.

160
00:09:00,158 --> 00:09:01,077
You don’t have to show him off.

161
00:09:01,458 --> 00:09:02,521
Where did you see him?

162
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:08,996
Did you do it like this?

163
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:10,939
You stalked me?

164
00:09:11,177 --> 00:09:14,744
Just because I disappeared doesn’t mean I didn’t care about you.

165
00:09:14,744 --> 00:09:17,103
Now that you’ve moved here, don’t be irresponsible.

166
00:09:17,103 --> 00:09:20,626
You have to keep up your good grades in university.

167
00:09:20,626 --> 00:09:23,904
You can’t just be an artist and ignore your studies.

168
00:09:23,904 --> 00:09:27,457
In case you break your legs someday and can no longer dance,
you need to know how to do something else for a living.

169
00:09:28,100 --> 00:09:29,727
Why do you say that, Mom?

170
00:09:30,203 --> 00:09:31,870
Don’t worry.

171
00:09:32,108 --> 00:09:34,333
I have Kang to manage everything.

172
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:36,254
Everything is going to be perfect.

173
00:09:37,825 --> 00:09:38,439
Right.

174
00:09:39,106 --> 00:09:40,759
It better be as you say.

175
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:43,309
Alright. I have to go.

176
00:09:43,857 --> 00:09:45,183
I have a meeting.

177
00:09:45,183 --> 00:09:46,826
I’ll drive you, Auntie Dao.

178
00:09:47,469 --> 00:09:48,502
See you.

179
00:09:49,382 --> 00:09:50,198
Bye, Mom.

180
00:09:50,198 --> 00:09:50,913
Bye.

181
00:10:01,007 --> 00:10:01,758
Shone.

182
00:10:03,186 --> 00:10:03,773
Yes?

183
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:07,148
You know about Moo and Kang, right?

184
00:10:10,387 --> 00:10:10,930
Yes.

185
00:10:12,311 --> 00:10:14,333
But I just found out today that they’re boyfriends now.

186
00:10:17,071 --> 00:10:21,250
Moo told me about falling in love

187
00:10:21,869 --> 00:10:23,631
and he improved himself as a person

188
00:10:24,488 --> 00:10:25,434
But there’s one thing.

189
00:10:27,268 --> 00:10:31,467
I want you to talk to Moo.

190
00:10:32,134 --> 00:10:33,663
He doesn’t really listen to me.

191
00:10:33,663 --> 00:10:35,281
He’s more likely to listen to you.

192
00:10:37,328 --> 00:10:38,029
Okay.

193
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:41,151
What is it about?

194
00:10:43,495 --> 00:10:44,480
Look.

195
00:10:44,718 --> 00:10:46,230
That TV is so much bigger than the one I had in Nakhon Pathom.

196
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:50,103
Look at that brand-new kitchen.
It’s waiting for Mr. Kang to cook for me.

197
00:10:50,222 --> 00:10:52,756
And this piano. I’ve played it since grade 1 or 2.

198
00:10:53,208 --> 00:10:55,603
I’ll play it for you when I have time.

199
00:10:55,817 --> 00:10:57,763
Look at this king-sized bed.

200
00:10:57,763 --> 00:10:58,887
It’s super soft.

201
00:10:58,887 --> 00:10:59,675
Can I hug you?

202
00:11:00,095 --> 00:11:00,988
No.

203
00:11:01,000 --> 00:11:02,358
Please, Kang.

204
00:11:03,239 --> 00:11:06,530
If you hug me to sleep, I’ll be so happy.

205
00:11:07,220 --> 00:11:07,880
Please.

206
00:12:19,780 --> 00:12:20,446
Let’s stop.

207
00:13:03,721 --> 00:13:08,553
You know, you’ve been with me since the day I had no one

208
00:13:09,316 --> 00:13:13,201
until now, when I see my Everest.

209
00:13:14,298 --> 00:13:15,843
I’m not climbing it alone.

210
00:13:15,986 --> 00:13:17,787
You’re climbing it with me.

211
00:13:20,005 --> 00:13:24,934
I’m just so happy to have you by my side.

212
00:13:25,602 --> 00:13:28,597
That happiness was so overwhelming that…

213
00:13:31,145 --> 00:13:32,243
Say no more.

214
00:13:33,960 --> 00:13:35,021
I know.

215
00:13:38,289 --> 00:13:43,069
I was just shy.

216
00:13:46,981 --> 00:13:48,044
Me too.

217
00:13:51,343 --> 00:13:55,851
I think we should take it slow.

218
00:14:00,049 --> 00:14:02,617
So, can I at least do this?

219
00:14:04,430 --> 00:14:05,204
Of course.

220
00:14:16,708 --> 00:14:17,336
Hey.

221
00:14:17,742 --> 00:14:18,876
Did you drop Mom off already?

222
00:14:20,832 --> 00:14:21,553
Yeah.

223
00:14:26,748 --> 00:14:27,580
Moo,

224
00:14:28,916 --> 00:14:30,133
can I talk to you?

225
00:14:31,130 --> 00:14:34,353
Please excuse me then.

226
00:14:41,858 --> 00:14:42,689
What is it?

227
00:14:46,124 --> 00:14:48,111
I think you should remove the clip you took with Kang.

228
00:14:48,755 --> 00:14:49,539
Why should I delete it?

229
00:14:49,921 --> 00:14:52,753
You’re becoming an artist.

230
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:55,117
Once you become famous, people will dig up your past.

231
00:14:55,308 --> 00:14:58,759
That clip could become a controversy in the future.

232
00:14:58,850 --> 00:14:59,996
What controversy?

233
00:15:01,642 --> 00:15:04,140
My relationship with Kang is not wrong.

234
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:05,180
That’s true,

235
00:15:05,896 --> 00:15:08,843
but once you become very famous and gain a lot of fans,

236
00:15:08,843 --> 00:15:13,109
some of them might not want you to date.

237
00:15:13,109 --> 00:15:14,214
What are you talking about?

238
00:15:14,214 --> 00:15:15,279
That’s total nonsense.

239
00:15:15,684 --> 00:15:17,211
Did Mom ask you to talk to me?

240
00:15:17,354 --> 00:15:18,490
You know it all, huh?

241
00:15:18,657 --> 00:15:19,447
Yeah.

242
00:15:20,807 --> 00:15:22,907
She said that if she talked to you herself, you wouldn’t listen.

243
00:15:22,907 --> 00:15:24,487
So she asked me to warn you.

244
00:15:24,726 --> 00:15:26,901
But I actually agree with her.

245
00:15:27,140 --> 00:15:28,960
Not everyone is going to understand you.

246
00:15:29,747 --> 00:15:32,300
It’s better to deal with what you can.

247
00:15:32,491 --> 00:15:35,686
Digital footprints are scary these days.

248
00:15:37,117 --> 00:15:38,150
Alright.

249
00:15:38,746 --> 00:15:40,008
I’ll delete it.

250
00:15:41,153 --> 00:15:42,031
Is that all?

251
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:52,775
[  Sorry that I didn’t invite you guys to sleep over at my condo.]

252
00:15:53,157 --> 00:15:55,956
[You know I want to be with Kang, right?]

253
00:15:57,888 --> 00:16:00,653
[Payos: I get it. See you tomorrow.]

254
00:16:06,410 --> 00:16:08,634
Moo, come eat.

255
00:16:09,421 --> 00:16:11,143
Okay, coming.

256
00:16:13,242 --> 00:16:14,133
I’m done.

257
00:16:18,188 --> 00:16:19,162
Here I am.

258
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:23,164
Wow, what did you cook for me today?

259
00:16:23,856 --> 00:16:25,224
Fried rice.

260
00:16:25,486 --> 00:16:27,617
You have to eat from the simple ingredients in the fridge for now.

261
00:16:28,404 --> 00:16:32,090
Actually, I’d love anything you cook for me.

262
00:16:34,060 --> 00:16:35,205
This looks so good.

263
00:16:38,449 --> 00:16:39,350
Why are you smiling?

264
00:16:39,684 --> 00:16:40,838
I’m so happy.

265
00:16:41,124 --> 00:16:44,614
Living with you feels like we’re practicing for our wedding night.

266
00:16:44,805 --> 00:16:46,095
Nonsense.

267
00:16:46,095 --> 00:16:48,549
After you finish eating, take a shower and go to bed.

268
00:16:48,740 --> 00:16:50,059
They want you to be there at 9 a.m., right?

269
00:16:50,059 --> 00:16:53,159
You should wake up at 7 a.m. so you have time to get ready.

270
00:16:53,588 --> 00:16:55,063
Noted, Mr. Manager.

271
00:16:55,210 --> 00:16:58,980
I’ll hurry to take a shower, go to bed, and lie down next to you.

272
00:16:59,490 --> 00:17:02,026
No, you sleep in the bedroom.

273
00:17:02,312 --> 00:17:03,495
I’ll sleep on the sofa.

274
00:17:04,521 --> 00:17:05,341
Why?

275
00:17:05,341 --> 00:17:07,147
This is our first night together.

276
00:17:07,147 --> 00:17:09,751
I’m your manager, you must listen to me.

277
00:17:09,751 --> 00:17:12,453
If you don’t listen to me, I’ll go back to Nakhon Pathom.

278
00:17:13,490 --> 00:17:14,457
Hurry up and eat.

279
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:15,411
Stop staring at me.

280
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,045
My door will be unlocked.

281
00:17:17,045 --> 00:17:17,802
You talk too much.

282
00:17:25,649 --> 00:17:26,703
Kang.

283
00:17:31,235 --> 00:17:32,336
Why aren’t you sleeping?

284
00:17:33,791 --> 00:17:36,547
I tried but couldn’t fall asleep.

285
00:17:37,167 --> 00:17:38,800
No one hugged me to sleep.

286
00:17:42,521 --> 00:17:43,727
What are you watching?

287
00:17:45,683 --> 00:17:46,921
The Way Home.

288
00:17:47,303 --> 00:17:48,131
Let me watch it with you.

289
00:17:49,944 --> 00:17:50,611
Moo.

290
00:17:50,993 --> 00:17:51,493
Yes.

291
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:53,260
Honestly,

292
00:17:54,023 --> 00:17:55,275
this is not comfortable.

293
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:57,345
Can you change your position?

294
00:17:58,800 --> 00:17:59,766
Moo, it’s heavy.

295
00:18:01,674 --> 00:18:02,725
Your hair is in the way.

296
00:18:03,536 --> 00:18:04,598
Okay. How about this?

297
00:18:05,075 --> 00:18:05,881
This will do.

298
00:18:07,121 --> 00:18:07,813
I feel comfortable now.

299
00:18:18,236 --> 00:18:18,981
Hey.

300
00:18:21,295 --> 00:18:22,064
Wow.

301
00:18:23,050 --> 00:18:24,013
Taken by the movie?

302
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:27,128
The grandson misses his grandma and sends her a blank letter.

303
00:18:28,130 --> 00:18:31,585
Will they reunite in the end?

304
00:18:31,930 --> 00:18:33,308
They will.

305
00:18:33,594 --> 00:18:35,061
He loves his grandma so much.

306
00:18:35,514 --> 00:18:37,945
Eventually, he will visit her.

307
00:18:38,804 --> 00:18:45,159
What if one day you and I don’t get to see each other anymore and you miss me, will you send me a blank letter?

308
00:18:46,113 --> 00:18:47,826
You don’t have to write anything.

309
00:18:49,233 --> 00:18:51,947
That way, I’ll know you sent it.

310
00:18:55,859 --> 00:18:57,236
It’s just a movie.

311
00:18:57,236 --> 00:18:58,376
Why are you so emotional?

312
00:19:02,073 --> 00:19:02,955
It’s late.

313
00:19:03,432 --> 00:19:04,166
You should go to bed.

314
00:19:06,246 --> 00:19:07,893
I want to sleep here.

315
00:19:13,689 --> 00:19:14,701
You’re so kind.

316
00:19:18,422 --> 00:19:20,310
Will you hug me?

317
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:22,182
That’d be even more kind.

318
00:19:23,756 --> 00:19:24,596

You’re very close to Moo, aren’t you?

457
00:27:26,548 --> 00:27:27,534
Yes, I am.

458
00:27:29,026 --> 00:27:32,459
From now on, please be careful when you see each other.

459
00:27:33,090 --> 00:27:35,482
I'm just afraid people will misunderstand.

Hi, everyone.

465
00:28:03,330 --> 00:28:06,517
Welcome to TTM’s New Wave Project.

466
00:28:06,970 --> 00:28:08,192
Hi.

467
00:28:09,071 --> 00:28:11,895
I was one of the judges who selected you all to be part of this project.

468
00:28:11,895 --> 00:28:15,291
Let’s give yourselves a big hand for making it to the training round.

469
00:28:20,237 --> 00:28:24,228
Out of the 10 of you here, no one knows how many of you will get to debut.

470
00:28:26,652 --> 00:28:29,056
Do your best.

471
00:28:29,935 --> 00:28:32,245
Fern, please tell them about the activities.

472
00:28:32,245 --> 00:28:32,999
Sure.

473
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:35,558
My name is Fern.

474
00:28:35,558 --> 00:28:38,520
I’m the producer of the New Wave Project.

475
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:43,346
Today, we’ll have the first test where your singing and dancing will be graded

476
00:28:43,346 --> 00:28:46,749
to find out which areas you need to work on.

477
00:28:47,010 --> 00:28:51,301
There will be a test every week, and scores will be shown in percentage.

478
00:28:52,580 --> 00:28:53,661
Excuse me.

479
00:28:54,140 --> 00:28:55,560
Who will do the grading,

480
00:28:55,560 --> 00:28:57,724
the judges or the viewers?

481
00:28:57,724 --> 00:29:00,738
30% of the scores will come from social media

482
00:29:00,738 --> 00:29:02,658
and 70% from the judges.

483
00:29:02,658 --> 00:29:05,099
There won’t be any nepotism, right?

484
00:29:07,523 --> 00:29:10,841
We’ll show the scores in real time for everyone to see.

485
00:29:12,173 --> 00:29:13,724
Any other questions?

486
00:29:16,650 --> 00:29:19,231
If not, let me explain more about the activities.

487
00:29:19,231 --> 00:29:19,970
Moo.

488
00:29:20,902 --> 00:29:21,435
What?

489
00:29:21,435 --> 00:29:22,835
Do you know the guy opposite you?

490
00:29:23,581 --> 00:29:24,874
He keeps staring at you.

491
00:29:25,450 --> 00:29:26,262
No.

492
00:29:26,848 --> 00:29:28,709
I also noticed him looking at me many times.

493
00:29:39,497 --> 00:29:42,392
Did you call me because you wanted to talk about something?

494
00:29:43,910 --> 00:29:47,704
I’ve been meaning to ask what the text on your bag means.

495
00:29:47,837 --> 00:29:52,402
Oh, Moo made this for me.

496
00:29:54,054 --> 00:29:56,542
I don’t know the meaning either.

497
00:29:56,542 --> 00:29:58,174
You have to ask him.

498
00:30:01,610 --> 00:30:03,554
Moo is crazy in love, isn’t he?

499
00:30:03,714 --> 00:30:05,074
He even made a bag for you.

500
00:30:06,246 --> 00:30:09,841
But being crazy in love is not always a good thing.

501
00:30:10,107 --> 00:30:11,556
That’s what I wanted to talk to you about.

502
00:30:14,007 --> 00:30:15,276
What did Moo doo?

503
00:30:17,247 --> 00:30:21,212
Auntie Dao asked me to warn him about posting you on social media.

504
00:30:22,464 --> 00:30:28,501
Soon, when he gets more famous, whatever is on social media might be dug up.

505
00:30:29,247 --> 00:30:33,829
No matter how much time passes, people with bad intentions will target him.

506
00:30:34,894 --> 00:30:40,114
I’m afraid that might not be good for many parties.

507
00:30:45,450 --> 00:30:46,079
Yeah.

508
00:30:47,145 --> 00:30:48,691
I understand, Shone.

509
00:30:50,902 --> 00:30:53,020
Please help me, Kang.

510
00:30:53,313 --> 00:30:54,921
You know that Moo is stubborn.

511
00:30:55,054 --> 00:30:57,926
I told him about this yesterday, but I don’t know if he listened.

512
00:30:59,205 --> 00:31:00,028
Okay.

513
00:31:00,587 --> 00:31:02,417
I’ll remind him again.

514
00:31:25,190 --> 00:31:27,013
[90 Points, A Grade]

515
00:31:54,982 --> 00:31:57,104
[60 Points, C Grade]

516
00:31:58,303 --> 00:31:59,704
Now that we’ve warmed up,

517
00:31:59,704 --> 00:32:01,957
we’re going to try the focus walk.

518
00:32:01,957 --> 00:32:04,849
Find your point of focus and walk over there.

519
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:05,494
Go.

520
00:32:06,586 --> 00:32:07,812
Eye level.

521
00:32:07,812 --> 00:32:08,400
Okay, good.

522
00:32:08,400 --> 00:32:09,149
Relax.

523
00:32:11,946 --> 00:32:14,326
And 1, 2,

524
00:32:14,326 --> 00:32:15,528
3 and 4

525
00:32:15,528 --> 00:32:16,960
and 5 and 6.

526
00:32:16,960 --> 00:32:18,738
Slide, 7, 8.

527
00:32:18,738 --> 00:32:20,225
Together everyone.

528
00:32:20,450 --> 00:32:22,053
Make it stronger.

529
00:32:22,053 --> 00:32:24,368
5, 6, 7, 8.

530
00:32:32,514 --> 00:32:34,735
Here are everyone’s scores.

531
00:32:43,911 --> 00:32:44,769
Look.

532
00:32:45,595 --> 00:32:46,555
We got the same score.

533
00:32:47,221 --> 00:32:48,150
We sure did.

534
00:32:50,730 --> 00:32:51,457
How many scores did you get?

535
00:32:54,334 --> 00:32:55,417
It’s alright, Tae.

536
00:33:03,528 --> 00:33:04,094
Tae.

537
00:33:04,210 --> 00:33:04,756
Hmm?

538
00:33:04,756 --> 00:33:05,454
What’s wrong?

539
00:33:05,454 --> 00:33:06,842
You don’t look like you’re enjoying yourself.

540
00:33:07,082 --> 00:33:08,390
I brought you a drink.

541
00:33:12,092 --> 00:33:13,027
Thank you.

542
00:33:13,610 --> 00:33:14,951
I got Cs in every area.

543
00:33:15,137 --> 00:33:15,724
What?

544
00:33:15,724 --> 00:33:16,370
Look.

545
00:33:16,929 --> 00:33:17,804
Hey.

546
00:33:19,695 --> 00:33:20,568
How come?

547
00:33:22,010 --> 00:33:23,003
I don’t know.

548
00:33:23,189 --> 00:33:23,731
What did you get?

549
00:33:23,731 --> 00:33:24,497
Can I see?

550
00:33:26,069 --> 00:33:29,345
Wow. Your scores are good.

551
00:33:32,142 --> 00:33:32,831
Hey.

552
00:33:32,964 --> 00:33:33,723
What’s wrong with you?

553
00:33:33,723 --> 00:33:34,715
What’s your problem with my friend?

554
00:33:34,715 --> 00:33:35,351
Tae.

555
00:33:35,450 --> 00:33:36,130
Calm down.

556
00:33:36,290 --> 00:33:36,972
Let me talk to him.

557
00:33:39,023 --> 00:33:39,995
What’s wrong with you?

558
00:33:40,128 --> 00:33:41,777
You also hit me in the acting class.

559
00:33:42,097 --> 00:33:45,039
I didn’t hit you. I just wanted to see you up close

560
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:46,867
if you’re the son of Ms. Dao of GP Entertainment.

561
00:33:47,010 --> 00:33:48,825
I have bad eyesight.

562
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:51,191
So, it’s really you.

563
00:33:51,410 --> 00:33:52,275
So what if it is?

564
00:33:52,728 --> 00:33:53,624
Nothing.

565
00:33:54,103 --> 00:33:55,523
I’m just curious.

566
00:33:55,656 --> 00:33:57,129
Originally, only eight people passed

567
00:33:57,129 --> 00:33:58,973
but somehow we got two more.

568
00:33:58,973 --> 00:34:01,371
I just wanted to know what the other two look like.

569
00:34:01,371 --> 00:34:03,863
But after seeing them, I get it.

570
00:34:06,101 --> 00:34:08,390
Oh, you got an A in singing?

571
00:34:08,869 --> 00:34:10,308
Did your mom tell them to write that for you?

572
00:34:10,308 --> 00:34:11,146
What the hell is wrong with you?

573
00:34:11,146 --> 00:34:12,229
Hey, stop.

574
00:34:12,922 --> 00:34:13,899
Calm down.

575
00:34:13,899 --> 00:34:14,692
Think carefully.

576
00:34:15,305 --> 00:34:16,285
It’s not worth it.

577
00:34:18,390 --> 00:34:19,627
I thought you were the real deal.

578
00:34:19,813 --> 00:34:21,599
This is the real deal.

579
00:34:22,185 --> 00:34:25,184
A, A, and A.

580
00:34:27,130 --> 00:34:27,902
What a waste of time.

581
00:34:30,770 --> 00:34:31,836
Who does he think he is?

582
00:34:31,943 --> 00:34:33,438
His face gets on my nerves.

583
00:34:33,610 --> 00:34:35,259
If he comes at you again, let me know.

584
00:34:35,259 --> 00:34:36,157
I’ll fight him for you.

585
00:34:36,743 --> 00:34:37,811
Tae, calm down.

586
00:34:37,930 --> 00:34:38,955
Don’t do it.

587
00:34:39,650 --> 00:34:41,170
And what’s wrong with you since this morning?

588
00:34:42,184 --> 00:34:43,445
You’ve been moody all day.

589
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,016
At first, he was the same,

590
00:34:47,016 --> 00:34:49,486
but since classes started, he won’t talk to me.

591
00:34:49,806 --> 00:34:51,242
He only talks to Jang.

592
00:34:52,044 --> 00:34:53,232
What are you really mad about?

593
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:54,995
I’m mad that he doesn’t talk to me.

594
00:34:56,912 --> 00:34:57,852
I don’t think so.

595
00:34:58,172 --> 00:34:59,602
I think you’re jealous.

596
00:35:01,239 --> 00:35:02,139
Are you crazy?

597
00:35:02,325 --> 00:35:03,665
I’ve been friends with him for so long.

598
00:35:03,665 --> 00:35:04,625
Why would I be jealous?

599
00:35:05,450 --> 00:35:08,569
Because you’ve been friends with him for so long, you don’t realize your feelings.

600
00:35:08,889 --> 00:35:10,181
Think carefully.

601
00:35:12,072 --> 00:35:14,273
You feel good when you’re with him, don’t you?

602
00:35:16,058 --> 00:35:16,736
Yeah.

603
00:35:17,588 --> 00:35:20,503
And you feel bad when he talks to someone else, don’t you?

604
00:35:21,169 --> 00:35:21,929
Yeah.

605
00:35:22,450 --> 00:35:25,806
And you want to be the only one he’s with, don’t you?

606
00:35:28,177 --> 00:35:29,437
- Don’t you?
- Yes.

607
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,602
This is clear as day.

608
00:35:32,238 --> 00:35:33,407
Don’t you realize your feelings by now?

609
00:35:33,730 --> 00:35:34,786
What is clear?

610
00:35:35,450 --> 00:35:36,897
I’ve been friends with him for so long.

611
00:35:37,570 --> 00:35:38,963
I’m just possessive of my friend.

612
00:35:39,530 --> 00:35:40,933
Okay. How about this?

613
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:43,114
If you want to know how you really feel,

614
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:46,473
try doing with him what friends don’t do.

615
00:35:46,926 --> 00:35:47,917
Then you’ll know.

616
00:35:49,888 --> 00:35:51,728
Now stop throwing tantrums already.

617
00:36:03,610 --> 00:36:04,472
I’m off.

618
00:36:09,187 --> 00:36:11,483
The three of you don’t have a house in Bangkok, right?

619
00:36:11,723 --> 00:36:12,399
No.

620
00:36:13,010 --> 00:36:18,912
I asked the team to prepare a room for you to share so you don’t have to travel back and forth every day during training.

621
00:36:19,338 --> 00:36:20,968
Oh, I’m staying at my relative’s.

622
00:36:20,968 --> 00:36:21,748
It’s not that far.

623
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,764
Oh, then it’s just the two of you.

624
00:36:24,764 --> 00:36:26,500
Great. You’re already best friends.

625
00:36:27,033 --> 00:36:28,553
It’s settled then.

626
00:36:35,854 --> 00:36:36,803
Are you okay with this?

627
00:36:39,409 --> 00:36:40,225
Of course.

628
00:36:42,889 --> 00:36:43,655
Let’s go.

629
00:36:54,139 --> 00:36:55,116
Hello, Dad.

630
00:36:55,116 --> 00:36:55,966
Hi, Tae.

631
00:36:56,286 --> 00:36:57,753
I won’t be home tonight.

632
00:36:59,804 --> 00:37:01,418
The company gave us a room.

633
00:37:01,951 --> 00:37:02,948
What company again?

634
00:37:05,275 --> 00:37:06,432
I’m an artist trainee, remember?

635
00:37:06,432 --> 00:37:08,319
Hey, don’t move that box inside.

636
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:09,333
It’s for the supplier.

637
00:37:09,546 --> 00:37:10,450
I have to go.

638
00:37:10,583 --> 00:37:11,950
I need to oversee the workers.

639
00:37:16,910 --> 00:37:18,035
Dad didn’t listen to me.

640
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:21,998
He’s probably busy.

641
00:37:24,182 --> 00:37:27,448
Yos, you can choose the bed.

642
00:37:37,811 --> 00:37:38,800
I’ll take the top bunk.

643
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:39,490
Hey.

644
00:37:40,450 --> 00:37:41,892
I don’t want you to sleep on the top bunk.

645
00:37:41,892 --> 00:37:45,044
I want you to choose between the bunk bed and the single bed.

646
00:37:46,217 --> 00:37:47,342
I’ve never slept on the top bunk.

647
00:37:47,581 --> 00:37:48,246
I want to try.

648
00:37:48,246 --> 00:37:49,048
Yos.

649
00:37:49,874 --> 00:37:52,037
Take the bottom bunk so we can talk.

650
00:37:57,607 --> 00:38:01,056
♪ What do you want me to do, me to do, baby? ♪

651
00:38:01,056 --> 00:38:04,981
♪ What can I do when my heart is falling? ♪

652
00:38:07,962 --> 00:38:09,337
Are you really going?

653
00:38:10,616 --> 00:38:12,144
I have to take care of my restaurant too.

654
00:38:14,115 --> 00:38:15,589
Can you please stay?

655
00:38:18,519 --> 00:38:20,075
I’ll be back in two days.

656
00:38:20,330 --> 00:38:21,185
Okay.

657
00:38:21,425 --> 00:38:23,117
Bring everything here when you come back.

658
00:38:23,117 --> 00:38:25,842
Bring your home and your motorbike

659
00:38:26,162 --> 00:38:27,849
so you can stay with me for months.

660
00:38:28,222 --> 00:38:29,246
Okay.

661
00:38:29,450 --> 00:38:30,366
Yay!

662
00:38:31,005 --> 00:38:32,734
Let’s eat.

663
00:38:34,518 --> 00:38:36,324
Kai Palo, my favorite.

664
00:38:41,146 --> 00:38:42,664
It’s so yummy.

665
00:38:42,930 --> 00:38:44,121
I feel so bad for the others.

666
00:38:44,574 --> 00:38:45,999
We’ve been tired from dance practice all day,

667
00:38:45,999 --> 00:38:50,262
but no one gets to come home and eat your special Kai Palo recipe like me.

668
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:54,051
Just one bite and I’m no longer tired.

669
00:38:55,890 --> 00:38:56,890
Stop exaggerating.

670
00:38:56,890 --> 00:38:57,830
I’m not.

671
00:38:58,629 --> 00:39:00,983
Your Kai Palo encourages me,

672
00:39:00,983 --> 00:39:03,287
keeps me going, and gets me ready to fight every day.

673
00:39:03,287 --> 00:39:05,529
If you don’t believe me, I’ll dance for you now.

674
00:39:05,768 --> 00:39:07,177
Come on. Let’s dance together.

675
00:39:07,337 --> 00:39:08,300
No.

676
00:39:08,517 --> 00:39:09,285
Keep eating.

677
00:39:09,924 --> 00:39:10,625
Come on.

678
00:39:11,371 --> 00:39:12,657
Your dance is so cute.

679
00:39:13,083 --> 00:39:14,128
You get a lot of likes.

680
00:39:14,128 --> 00:39:15,033
Did you see that?

681
00:39:16,844 --> 00:39:17,858
About that clip,

682
00:39:18,867 --> 00:39:20,695
I think you should delete it.

683
00:39:22,006 --> 00:39:23,182
Why?

684
00:39:23,342 --> 00:39:24,210
It’s cute.

685
00:39:24,609 --> 00:39:26,689
Please listen to your mom and Shone.

686
00:39:27,248 --> 00:39:28,085
They mean well.

687
00:39:28,485 --> 00:39:29,881
Don’t worry.

688
00:39:30,014 --> 00:39:31,068
Nothing will happen.

689
00:39:31,743 --> 00:39:33,163
People can separate my work from my personal life.

690
00:39:34,095 --> 00:39:36,151
But some people can’t, Moo.

691
00:39:36,337 --> 00:39:37,484
I’m not afraid.

692
00:39:37,484 --> 00:39:39,723
If there’s to be drama, I’m ready to face it.

693
00:39:40,682 --> 00:39:43,860
As long as you stay by my side and don’t let go of my hand,

694
00:39:43,967 --> 00:39:46,316
I’m ready to fight any drama.

695
00:39:48,314 --> 00:39:50,251
I want you to think again.

696
00:39:51,796 --> 00:39:53,160
You should listen to the adults.

697
00:39:53,586 --> 00:39:54,389
I do.

698
00:39:54,682 --> 00:39:57,310
But I have my own reasons too.

699
00:39:59,681 --> 00:40:02,762
Trust me. It’s just a dance clip.

700
00:40:02,762 --> 00:40:03,632
Nothing will come of it.

701
00:40:03,632 --> 00:40:05,061
Stop talking about this.

702
00:40:05,061 --> 00:40:07,407
Let me eat my delicious Kai Palo in peace.

703
00:40:08,153 --> 00:40:08,830
Do you want a drink?

704
00:40:08,830 --> 00:40:09,717
I’ll get it for you.

705
00:40:09,717 --> 00:40:11,157
No, I’ll get it myself.

706
00:40:20,001 --> 00:40:20,899
Kang,

707
00:40:21,032 --> 00:40:23,229
before you go, I want you to do something.

708
00:40:23,655 --> 00:40:24,470
Get up.

709
00:40:25,616 --> 00:40:26,533
Fine.

710
00:40:28,450 --> 00:40:29,486
Hold your nose.

711
00:40:29,832 --> 00:40:30,867
Do I have to?

712
00:40:30,867 --> 00:40:31,672
Yes.

713
00:40:32,844 --> 00:40:35,219
Hold your nose and slowly drink this.

714
00:40:35,450 --> 00:40:38,301
I’ll tell you why I’m doing this later.

715
00:40:46,292 --> 00:40:47,129
What are you doing?

716
00:40:47,129 --> 00:40:51,774
Normally, when we drink water, air will replace the water that comes out of the bottle.

717
00:40:51,774 --> 00:40:54,587
When you held your nose earlier, you were breathing through your mouth.

718
00:40:54,800 --> 00:40:57,624
It means your breath got in here.

719
00:41:05,482 --> 00:41:06,500
This is so refreshing.

720
00:41:06,900 --> 00:41:10,461
Even though you won’t be here, your breath is already in my body.

721
00:41:11,313 --> 00:41:13,833
Consider this a tea with breath.

722
00:41:13,833 --> 00:41:16,935
It’ll help me miss you a little less.

723
00:41:28,212 --> 00:41:28,881
Hey, Moo.

724
00:41:30,705 --> 00:41:32,706
This one is good, but please move this one a bit to the left.

725
00:41:32,706 --> 00:41:33,220
Okay.

726
00:41:34,354 --> 00:41:34,904
Bro,

727
00:41:35,861 --> 00:41:37,553
stop everything you’re doing.

728
00:41:49,583 --> 00:41:50,083
What’s going on?

729
00:41:51,075 --> 00:41:53,446
Why did you tell Kang about removing the clip?

730
00:41:54,580 --> 00:41:56,155
You made him worry, you know?

731
00:41:58,493 --> 00:41:59,319
Listen, Moo.

732
00:42:00,276 --> 00:42:01,957
Everyone else is worried.

733
00:42:02,719 --> 00:42:04,003
Only you feel nothing.

734
00:42:05,916 --> 00:42:06,850
What’s there to worry about?

735
00:42:07,629 --> 00:42:08,878
What are you guys so afraid of?

736
00:42:11,216 --> 00:42:14,942
Auntie Dao and I don’t want you to face any problems in the future.

737
00:42:16,235 --> 00:42:19,287
What you’re doing is going to ruin your dream.

738
00:42:20,261 --> 00:42:20,964
Do you understand?

739
00:42:22,009 --> 00:42:24,096
But I think it’s all in your and Mom’s head.

740
00:42:24,805 --> 00:42:25,923
Think from another perspective.

741
00:42:26,897 --> 00:42:30,392
If I lie that I’m not dating anyone and one day people find out,

742
00:42:31,211 --> 00:42:32,362
that’ll be even worse.

743
00:42:32,964 --> 00:42:36,491
That’s not being honest with other people, my boyfriend,

744
00:42:37,022 --> 00:42:38,227
and everything.

745
00:42:41,416 --> 00:42:42,332
Listen, Moo.

746
00:42:43,519 --> 00:42:45,627
No one is asking you to lie.

747
00:42:45,627 --> 00:42:46,609
Don’t get it wrong.

748
00:42:47,318 --> 00:42:50,232
Just don’t go around announcing it like you’ve been doing.

749
00:42:51,773 --> 00:42:52,845
It’s the same thing.

750
00:42:53,748 --> 00:42:55,932
Not talking about it and not acknowledging it

751
00:42:56,729 --> 00:42:58,254
is the same as lying.

752
00:42:59,228 --> 00:43:03,025
My posting that clip wasn’t even announcing it.

753
00:43:03,734 --> 00:43:04,929
I just posted it because I wanted to.

754
00:43:05,673 --> 00:43:06,870
It's a cute clip of us.

755
00:43:08,234 --> 00:43:09,228
We love each other.

756
00:43:09,883 --> 00:43:10,690
That’s all.

757
00:43:14,785 --> 00:43:15,285
Okay.

758
00:43:17,198 --> 00:43:18,783
I don’t know what to say to you anymore.

759
00:43:19,899 --> 00:43:22,936
I’m doing this because I’m worried about you.

760
00:43:23,113 --> 00:43:24,999
Don’t get me wrong, okay?

761
00:43:26,186 --> 00:43:29,906
Just don’t go around announcing it.

762
00:43:30,561 --> 00:43:31,484
I beg you.

763
00:43:38,322 --> 00:43:40,200
No one is asking you to lie.

764
00:43:40,466 --> 00:43:41,398
Don’t get it wrong.

765
00:43:42,177 --> 00:43:45,047
Just don’t go around announcing it like you’ve been doing.

766
00:43:45,472 --> 00:43:46,543
Announce it?

767
00:43:48,847 --> 00:43:49,628
[Video uploaded]

768
00:43:49,628 --> 00:43:51,594
This is how to announce it.

769
00:43:57,706 --> 00:43:59,835
You’re back.

770
00:43:59,835 --> 00:44:02,058
How was your first night?

771
00:44:02,359 --> 00:44:03,276
Spill.

772
00:44:03,914 --> 00:44:05,450
Nothing you think happened.

773
00:44:05,450 --> 00:44:06,333
Go home and sleep.

774
00:44:06,333 --> 00:44:07,152
Off you go.

775
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:11,972
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

776
00:44:11,972 --> 00:44:13,790
There’s someone I want to introduce.

777
00:44:14,959 --> 00:44:18,005
I met him when I went to a rice and curry shop to buy a toothbrush.

778
00:44:18,483 --> 00:44:20,739
He’s the kindest guy in the world.

779
00:44:20,934 --> 00:44:22,305
The cutest guy in my heart.

780
00:44:22,305 --> 00:44:26,491
Ever since I’ve known him, he’s made me smile and laugh nonstop.

781
00:44:26,650 --> 00:44:28,083
He’s my special someone.

782
00:44:28,083 --> 00:44:30,409
He’s my Kang.

783
00:44:52,211 --> 00:44:53,404
What’s up, Kang?

784
00:44:54,166 --> 00:44:55,378
Why did you dismiss my calls?

785
00:44:55,803 --> 00:44:57,464
Calm down.

786
00:44:57,464 --> 00:44:59,645
You called me because you like it, right?

787
00:44:59,731 --> 00:45:01,712
I told you to delete the clip. Why did you post a new one?

788
00:45:01,811 --> 00:45:06,252
I wanted to proudly present to the world that you’re my boyfriend.

789
00:45:09,972 --> 00:45:10,964
Do you like it?

790
00:45:11,230 --> 00:45:12,725
Can you tell me and make me happy?

791
00:45:12,902 --> 00:45:17,041
If you’re too shy to say it on the call, come and whisper it in my ear.

792
00:45:17,395 --> 00:45:19,567
I miss you. I want to see you so badly.

793
00:45:20,205 --> 00:45:20,909
Please.

794
00:45:25,090 --> 00:45:25,593
Give me a second.

795
00:45:30,482 --> 00:45:31,325
Listen, Kang.

796
00:45:34,107 --> 00:45:35,492
Listen, people of Bangkok.

797
00:45:35,793 --> 00:45:37,144
I love Kang!

00:45:37,941 --> 00:45:40,568
Do you hear me? I love Kang!

Do you hear me? I love Kang!

I love Kang!

Romantic relationships are strictly prohibited while you’re under this contract.

You’re only a few steps away from reaching the summit of your Everest.

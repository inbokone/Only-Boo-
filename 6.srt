4

What you should do is spend time focusing on your studies

5
00:00:21,737 --> 00:00:24,467
so your mom will be accepting of you following your dream.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:27,632
TTM’s New Wave Project is coming up soon.

7
00:00:27,737 --> 00:00:29,224
You and I must reach the finish line.

8
00:00:29,671 --> 00:00:30,772
We must win this time.

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,605
If I pass the audition, you must be honest with your heart.

10
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:39,612
It’s okay that we’re not a couple yet,

11
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:43,411
but can you please hold off on dating anyone else?

12
00:00:45,996 --> 00:00:46,892
Of course.

13
00:00:53,715 --> 00:00:56,662
Your Kai Palo with rice is still as tasty as ever.

14
00:00:56,921 --> 00:01:01,800
This time, I have something different to give you in return.

15
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:03,077
Are you going to pay me?

16
00:01:03,077 --> 00:01:03,897
No.

17
00:01:04,545 --> 00:01:06,545
I’m going to teach you to dance.

18
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,240
You want me to dance?

19
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:09,933
Yes.

20
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:11,072
I can’t dance.

21
00:01:11,072 --> 00:01:12,304
It’s okay. I’m going to teach you.

22
00:01:12,304 --> 00:01:13,000
Let’s go.

23
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:14,353
No.

24
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:15,828
Come on.

25
00:01:17,011 --> 00:01:17,789
Come on.

26
00:01:17,789 --> 00:01:18,468
I can’t do it.

27
00:01:18,468 --> 00:01:19,786
I’m going to teach you.

28
00:01:19,786 --> 00:01:20,924
It’s very easy. I know you can do it.

29
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:23,720
But I’ve never danced before.

30
00:01:23,942 --> 00:01:27,204
I can teach you how to dance in a few minutes.

31
00:01:27,668 --> 00:01:28,324
Here.

32
00:01:30,131 --> 00:01:32,448

That’s it?

38
00:01:46,323 --> 00:01:46,960
That’s it.

39
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,111
See? You can do it.

40
00:01:48,111 --> 00:01:48,976
Let me start filming now.

41
00:01:48,976 --> 00:01:49,898
Okay.

42
00:01:50,793 --> 00:01:52,293
Why don’t you smile, Kang?

43
00:01:52,293 --> 00:01:53,082
Smile.

44
00:01:53,082 --> 00:01:54,044
Smile like this.

45
00:01:55,152 --> 00:01:55,822
Do I have to smile?

46
00:01:55,822 --> 00:01:56,495
Yes.

47
00:01:57,068 --> 00:01:57,825
Very good.

48
00:01:57,825 --> 00:01:58,404

EP 6: I SEE MY DESTINATION

54
00:03:29,205 --> 00:03:29,800
Middle.

55
00:03:30,352 --> 00:03:31,028
Lift.

56
00:03:31,606 --> 00:03:32,903
Yes. Heart shape.

57
00:03:33,192 --> 00:03:34,085
That’s funny.

58
00:03:34,520 --> 00:03:36,096
I look like I’m trying too hard.

59
00:03:36,490 --> 00:03:38,381
No, you look natural.

60
00:03:56,113 --> 00:03:59,889
I think you’ve designed lovely choreography.

61
00:04:01,025 --> 00:04:02,009
The question is, do you love me?

62
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:06,056
You’re too much.

63
00:04:09,001 --> 00:04:10,021
What’s your username?

64
00:04:10,021 --> 00:04:10,791
I’ll tag you.

65
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:12,322
You don’t have to tag me.

66
00:04:13,242 --> 00:04:15,068
I quit social media a long time ago.

67
00:04:15,568 --> 00:04:16,623
I forgot my password.

68
00:04:17,596 --> 00:04:18,779
No.

69
00:04:19,279 --> 00:04:23,572
You have to have an account so you can follow me when I’m famous.

70
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:26,201
I’ll follow you when you’re famous.

71
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:28,094
No, you have to follow me now.

72
00:04:28,094 --> 00:04:29,031
Give me your phone.

73
00:04:29,347 --> 00:04:30,468
I’ll set up a new password for you.

74
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:32,547
Come on.

75
00:04:33,625 --> 00:04:34,564
Fine.

76
00:04:38,771 --> 00:04:39,385
Here.

77
00:04:41,527 --> 00:04:43,765
What password should we use?

78
00:04:47,026 --> 00:04:47,857
I have an idea.

79
00:04:55,535 --> 00:04:56,224
Okay.

80
00:04:56,855 --> 00:04:59,554
I already logged in and followed my account.

81
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,567
You’re definitely going to remember your password.

82
00:05:02,567 --> 00:05:03,328
It’s very easy.

83
00:05:05,142 --> 00:05:06,039
What’s the password?

84
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:07,223
Do you have a paper to note it down?

85
00:05:08,564 --> 00:05:09,821
I have some over there.

86
00:05:09,821 --> 00:05:10,765
Go get it yourself.

87
00:05:10,923 --> 00:05:11,487
Okay.

88
00:05:22,189 --> 00:05:22,983
Here.

89
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:24,471
Moo!

90
00:05:24,471 --> 00:05:25,814
What’s this crazy password?

91
00:05:26,003 --> 00:05:27,296
It’s like something out of the Da Vinci Code.

92
00:05:29,426 --> 00:05:30,520
How is it easy?

93
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:31,670
It’s easy.

94
00:05:31,670 --> 00:05:32,570
I’m sure you’ll remember it.

95
00:05:38,813 --> 00:05:40,813
Your Kai Palo was so delicious today.

96
00:05:40,813 --> 00:05:42,391
Do you have more I can eat tomorrow?

97
00:05:42,391 --> 00:05:44,137
Do you want to eat it? I can make it for you.

98
00:05:44,137 --> 00:05:44,741
Yes.

99
00:05:52,131 --> 00:05:52,858
Hello, Mom.

100
00:05:53,068 --> 00:05:54,341
What are you doing?

101
00:05:54,341 --> 00:05:55,353
Why is it so loud over there?

102
00:05:55,353 --> 00:05:57,296
I’m on a motorbike on the way back to my dorm.

103
00:05:57,296 --> 00:05:59,019
Who’s riding? Your friend?

104
00:05:59,274 --> 00:06:01,590
No, it’s the person I’m pursuing.

105
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,351
Do you want me to show his face?

106
00:06:02,682 --> 00:06:03,828
No need, Moo.

107
00:06:03,828 --> 00:06:04,340
No need.

108
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:05,397
Hey, Moo!

109
00:06:05,397 --> 00:06:06,167
Kang!

110
00:06:06,167 --> 00:06:06,920
What are you doing?

111
00:06:06,920 --> 00:06:07,921
It’s dangerous.

112
00:06:07,921 --> 00:06:10,422
Call me when you get to your dorm.

113
00:06:10,422 --> 00:06:11,010
Talk later.

114
00:06:11,241 --> 00:06:12,715
Okay. Bye.

115
00:06:14,551 --> 00:06:15,593
What’s the matter with you?

116
00:06:16,224 --> 00:06:18,234
Don’t tell me you’re shy with my mom.

117
00:06:18,497 --> 00:06:20,485
I’m not shy. It’s dangerous.

118
00:06:20,485 --> 00:06:22,432
You’re becoming her son-in-law. Don’t be shy.

119
00:06:22,748 --> 00:06:24,180
Just sit still.

120
00:06:24,609 --> 00:06:25,959
What do I get by doing that?

121
00:06:26,576 --> 00:06:28,076
Do whatever you want.

122
00:06:41,109 --> 00:06:43,336
Can I get something else too?

123
00:06:44,282 --> 00:06:45,212
Like what?

124
00:06:45,212 --> 00:06:47,585
Like a kiss.

125
00:06:47,787 --> 00:06:49,088
Don’t get too comfortable.

126
00:06:49,377 --> 00:06:50,171
Can I?

127
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:51,642
At least let me kiss your helmet.

128
00:06:51,958 --> 00:06:53,209
Whatever.

129
00:06:55,576 --> 00:06:57,817
Hey, Moo! Sit properly.

130
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:01,309
I already kissed you.

131
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:02,846
What else do you want?

132
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:04,040
Give me something in return.

133
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:04,774
Anything.

134
00:07:05,000 --> 00:07:06,644
I’m riding. It’s dangerous.

135
00:07:06,644 --> 00:07:07,955
One hand will do.

136
00:07:10,131 --> 00:07:11,159
More.

137
00:07:14,156 --> 00:07:15,071
Ouch!

138
00:07:15,071 --> 00:07:16,163
Stay still.

139
00:07:16,866 --> 00:07:18,103
It’s dangerous.

140
00:07:29,311 --> 00:07:30,573
Thank you, big bro.

141
00:07:30,757 --> 00:07:33,212
That’s what you should’ve introduced me to your mom as.

142
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:36,650
How could I introduce the person I’m pursuing as my big bro?

143
00:07:36,650 --> 00:07:38,789
You dare talk to your mom about this?

144
00:07:39,367 --> 00:07:40,178
Yes.

145
00:07:40,178 --> 00:07:41,656
My mom and I always talk like that.

146
00:07:41,656 --> 00:07:44,724
She taught me we should be honest and open with each other.

147
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,360
I was thinking that if I passed the audition,

148
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:51,418
I’d take you to see her and tell her you’re my boyfriend.

149
00:07:52,481 --> 00:07:54,481
Stop being delusional.

150
00:07:54,481 --> 00:07:55,519
Go to bed.

151
00:07:55,861 --> 00:07:56,506
Come on.

152
00:07:56,506 --> 00:07:58,480
Tomorrow morning, you can continue chasing your dream.

153
00:07:58,718 --> 00:08:00,600
Okay. Bye-bye.

154
00:08:02,376 --> 00:08:03,903
Oh, I forgot to return the helmet.

155
00:08:04,458 --> 00:08:05,494
Love you.

156
00:08:06,200 --> 00:08:07,427
What’s wrong with you?

157
00:08:11,584 --> 00:08:13,821
What’s up, buddy?

158
00:08:14,070 --> 00:08:16,480
I thought you said your Moo was gone from your life.

159
00:08:16,480 --> 00:08:18,097
How did he come back?

160
00:08:18,097 --> 00:08:19,436
Why are you here?

161
00:08:19,436 --> 00:08:21,914
I’m Neth. I own this dorm.

162
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:26,283
Wow. Your Moo is sassy.

163
00:08:26,632 --> 00:08:28,814
He’s brave enough to tell his mom he’s hitting on you.

164
00:08:29,156 --> 00:08:32,371
How was meeting your future mother-in-law for the first time?

165
00:08:32,371 --> 00:08:33,818
Did she accept your Wai?

166
00:08:34,002 --> 00:08:35,460
I didn’t Wai her.

167
00:08:35,460 --> 00:08:38,057
I had to keep my hands on both handles of my motorbike.

168
00:08:38,215 --> 00:08:40,772
If I had Wai her, I’d be in a hospital now.

169
00:08:40,772 --> 00:08:41,516
Fine.

170
00:08:43,261 --> 00:08:47,397
But Moo was so determined to do as you said.

171
00:08:47,765 --> 00:08:51,204
You should do as you said too.

172
00:08:51,204 --> 00:08:52,025
Right?

173
00:08:53,813 --> 00:08:54,680
Yeah.

174
00:08:55,811 --> 00:08:57,880
I think I like him.

175
00:08:59,507 --> 00:09:00,723
I like him so much.

176
00:09:01,196 --> 00:09:02,269
Stop it.

177
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,280
The other day when I asked what’s holding you back,

178
00:09:06,543 --> 00:09:09,127
it’s mainly your mom, right?

179
00:09:09,705 --> 00:09:11,701
The other things were just excuses.

180
00:09:12,437 --> 00:09:13,481
You’re the worst.

181
00:09:14,822 --> 00:09:17,248
Fine. You know me so well.

182
00:09:17,248 --> 00:09:19,063
Of course. I’m your friend.

183
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:23,957
If you want to be serious about this relationship and keep it going,

184
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:29,097
your next step is to talk to your mom.

185
00:09:30,813 --> 00:09:34,180
I believe she’ll understand you, Kang.

186
00:09:41,645 --> 00:09:45,000
You know how I always barely passed my social studies exam, right?

187
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,006
This time, I only got 7 questions wrong.

188
00:09:48,577 --> 00:09:49,776
Do you want to clean your nose first?

189
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:55,554
Where were we?

190
00:09:55,554 --> 00:09:56,858
Oh, social studies.

191
00:09:56,858 --> 00:09:58,475
After social studies, I took the English exam

192
00:09:58,475 --> 00:10:01,108
which I thought I wouldn’t know what to do

193
00:10:01,108 --> 00:10:04,789
but as it turns out, I found it very easy.

194
00:10:04,921 --> 00:10:07,631
Why did you stuff the tissue in your nose?

195
00:10:07,631 --> 00:10:09,046
You’re done using it. Now throw it away.

196
00:10:09,638 --> 00:10:11,240
Why would I throw it away and waste it?

197
00:10:13,358 --> 00:10:16,440
And what have you been sewing?

198
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:18,172
This? It’s a bag.

199
00:10:18,280 --> 00:10:20,000
Wow.

200
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:22,338
You know the value of money now.

201
00:10:22,338 --> 00:10:24,984

204

Okay.

205

Now stop telling me about your studies.

206

210

Only a few months there and you’re dating someone already?

211

Not yet, Mom. Calm down.

212

213

Wow. He’s older?

214
00:10:48,884 --> 00:10:50,063
Only by two years.

215
00:10:50,273 --> 00:10:52,374

We’re not boyfriends yet.

217

He said I should focus on improving myself first before thinking about our relationship.

218
00:10:57,400 --> 00:10:59,273
That’s why I’ve been studying hard, as you can see.

Yeah. You did it.

Yes, but there’s still one thing I haven’t achieved.

What is it?

222

My dream.

223
00:11:16,712 --> 00:11:19,738
I told him that if I passed the audition,

224
00:11:19,738 --> 00:11:21,870
he must agree to date me.

Hmm?

239

How did Dad woo you?

240
00:12:19,076 --> 00:12:20,576
Which specific period do you want to know?

241
00:12:22,362 --> 00:12:23,698
How about this period?

242
00:12:23,698 --> 00:12:27,156
When I was young, I sold rice and curry near Phra Pathom Chedi

243
00:12:27,156 --> 00:12:30,275
and your dad was a minibus driver nearby.

244
00:12:30,275 --> 00:12:33,731
He stopped by 4-5 times a day.

245
00:12:33,731 --> 00:12:36,600
I was like, “Did I give him too little food?”,

246
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,981
so the next time he came, I gave him a heaping plate of food.

247
00:12:40,554 --> 00:12:45,788
His friends in the area later told me he was so full but too scared to tell me the truth.

248
00:12:45,788 --> 00:12:48,345
Your dad put up a big front.

249
00:12:48,345 --> 00:12:51,911
He wouldn’t say things directly. He’s exactly like you.

250
00:13:00,494 --> 00:13:03,072
Why do you ask? Who are you going to woo?

251
00:13:06,080 --> 00:13:10,578
But seeing how you are, I think someone is wooing you, not the other way around.

What are you talking about?

00:18:10,341 --> 00:18:10,994
Here.

341
00:18:11,317 --> 00:18:12,997
I saw you’ve been using your current one for a long time.

342
00:18:13,481 --> 00:18:14,704
So I brought you a new one.

343
00:18:15,080 --> 00:18:16,746
Do you remember what this means?

344
00:18:20,576 --> 00:18:22,174
[Love you, Kang]

345
00:18:25,011 --> 00:18:26,839
Yes, I know what it means.

346
00:18:29,031 --> 00:18:29,966
Let me put it on you.

347
00:18:29,966 --> 00:18:30,785
Come closer.

348
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,314
You look so cool and handsome.

349
00:18:34,558 --> 00:18:37,615
You’ll carry the bag on your body and my message in your heart.

350
00:18:40,680 --> 00:18:41,586
Thanks.

351
00:18:41,920 --> 00:18:43,941
Can you do me a favor instead of saying thank you?

352
00:18:44,725 --> 00:18:46,331
Will you act as my parent?

353
00:18:46,920 --> 00:18:48,209
I passed the audition,

354
00:18:48,209 --> 00:18:49,699
but I’m not 20 yet.

355
00:18:49,814 --> 00:18:52,329
I need my parents’ permission to join the contest.

356
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,645
How can I be your parent?

357
00:18:54,645 --> 00:18:55,650
Ask your mom.

358
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:57,295
My mom won’t sign it.

359
00:18:57,295 --> 00:18:59,990
I thought once your grades are good, your mom would come to understand.

360
00:18:59,990 --> 00:19:01,304
I thought so too.

361
00:19:01,489 --> 00:19:05,299
I tried to bring it up to her last night, but she cut me off.

362
00:19:05,480 --> 00:19:06,513
Can you please help me?

363
00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,089
Please, Kang.

364
00:19:08,089 --> 00:19:08,887
I beg you.

365
00:19:08,887 --> 00:19:09,915
Please, Kang.

366
00:19:09,915 --> 00:19:10,769
Pretty please?

367
00:19:10,769 --> 00:19:11,389
I can’t.

368
00:19:12,335 --> 00:19:16,423
They need your parent’s signature because you’re still a minor

369
00:19:16,423 --> 00:19:18,116
and to prevent future problems.

370
00:19:18,116 --> 00:19:20,022
You need to convince your mom to sign it,

371
00:19:20,022 --> 00:19:21,319
not ask me to be your parent.

372
00:19:23,788 --> 00:19:24,582
Do you understand?

373
00:19:32,564 --> 00:19:33,377
Wait.

374
00:19:48,865 --> 00:19:50,336
Even though I can’t sign the letter for you,

375
00:19:51,213 --> 00:19:52,893
I can give you my encouragement.

376
00:19:58,782 --> 00:20:00,001
Thank you, Kang.

377
00:20:02,483 --> 00:20:03,385
I got to go.

378
00:20:03,385 --> 00:20:04,137
Okay.

379
00:20:11,361 --> 00:20:12,185
Hey, Moo.

380
00:20:12,946 --> 00:20:13,868
What brings you guys here?

381
00:20:18,728 --> 00:20:19,883
Are you okay?

382
00:20:20,829 --> 00:20:21,674
No.

383
00:20:21,674 --> 00:20:23,081
What are we going to do?

384
00:20:24,160 --> 00:20:25,531
My mom won’t sign it.

385
00:20:25,669 --> 00:20:27,554
I’m sorry, guys.

386
00:20:27,808 --> 00:20:30,274
I don’t think I can continue this with you.

387
00:20:30,666 --> 00:20:31,990
There must be a way.

388
00:20:32,451 --> 00:20:34,649
Don’t give up yet.

389
00:20:35,712 --> 00:20:37,044
I know my mom.

390
00:20:37,205 --> 00:20:38,466
There’s no way she’s going to sign it.

391
00:20:41,050 --> 00:20:44,297
When is she visiting again?

392
00:20:44,574 --> 00:20:45,389
This Saturday.

393
00:20:45,389 --> 00:20:47,039
She’s taking me out for a meal.

394
00:20:47,160 --> 00:20:47,968
Okay.

395
00:20:48,499 --> 00:20:51,223
Yos and I will persuade her.

396
00:20:52,818 --> 00:20:55,089
Tae, how are you going to persuade his mom?

397
00:20:55,366 --> 00:20:56,178
Come on, Yos.

398
00:20:56,501 --> 00:20:58,635
How many girls have fallen for my words?

399
00:20:59,800 --> 00:21:01,147
I can persuade her.

400
00:21:24,407 --> 00:21:25,368
Hi, Dad.

401
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:27,088
Are you busy?

402
00:21:28,057 --> 00:21:29,258
Are you coming home today?

403
00:21:30,550 --> 00:21:33,049
I want you to sign a permission letter for me to become an idol.

404
00:21:33,880 --> 00:21:35,621
I don’t think your mom and I will be home tonight.

405
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,810
We have to supervise the workers.

406
00:21:36,810 --> 00:21:37,834
You can sign it yourself.

407
00:21:38,388 --> 00:21:39,233
It should be okay.

408
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:47,770
Alright.

409
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:14,285
Here’s your fried chicken with rice, Suay.

410
00:22:14,285 --> 00:22:15,584
Enjoy.

411
00:22:17,013 --> 00:22:18,044
Hey, Kang.

412
00:22:18,044 --> 00:22:19,013
Are you leaving already?

413
00:22:19,184 --> 00:22:21,626
Mom? I asked you to close for a day.

414
00:22:21,626 --> 00:22:24,560
Come on. I can run this while you’re away.

415
00:22:26,920 --> 00:22:28,585
I’ll ask Neth to come and help.

416
00:22:30,015 --> 00:22:31,007
Fine.

417
00:22:37,586 --> 00:22:38,415
What’s up?

418
00:22:38,876 --> 00:22:40,250
Can you come help my mom out at the restaurant?

419
00:22:42,996 --> 00:22:44,009
It’s Saturday.

420
00:22:44,332 --> 00:22:45,381
Why are you busy?

421
00:22:46,027 --> 00:22:46,819
Where are you going?

422
00:22:47,650 --> 00:22:48,817
I have something to do.

423
00:22:49,371 --> 00:22:50,184
Just come and help her

424
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:52,539
in exchange for your free food.

425
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:54,846
Sure, I’m available to help,

426
00:22:54,846 --> 00:22:58,476
but first, you have to tell me where you’re going, who you’re going with, and what you’re going to do.

427
00:22:58,720 --> 00:23:01,920
Are you going on a date with Moo?

428
00:23:03,954 --> 00:23:04,732
Hi, Auntie.

429
00:23:04,732 --> 00:23:06,300
Oh, hi.

430
00:23:06,300 --> 00:23:07,577
Have you eaten?

431
00:23:07,687 --> 00:23:08,464
Yes.

432
00:23:08,464 --> 00:23:10,080
How are you doing? I hope you’re well.

433
00:23:10,672 --> 00:23:11,504
Who’s that?

434
00:23:11,827 --> 00:23:12,995
Talk later.

435
00:23:12,995 --> 00:23:13,904
I got to go.

436
00:23:13,904 --> 00:23:14,793
Don’t forget to come and help my mom.

437
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:15,492
Wait, Kang.

438
00:23:17,343 --> 00:23:19,615
Can I borrow Kang to be my tour guide for a day?

439
00:23:20,561 --> 00:23:21,569
Of course.

440
00:23:21,569 --> 00:23:22,578
You’re welcome to.

441
00:23:23,039 --> 00:23:24,097
- Hi, Shone.
- Hi.

442
00:23:25,481 --> 00:23:27,822
I’m leaving then.

443
00:23:27,822 --> 00:23:29,459
Go. Don’t worry about me.

444
00:23:29,459 --> 00:23:30,688
Enjoy your trip.

445
00:23:30,688 --> 00:23:31,896
- Have a good day.
- You too.

446
00:23:31,896 --> 00:23:33,024
Neth is coming to help.

447
00:23:33,439 --> 00:23:34,654
- Alright. Don’t worry.
- Take care.

448
00:23:34,654 --> 00:23:36,224
Don’t worry. Just go.

449
00:23:38,711 --> 00:23:40,184
I knew it.

450
00:23:41,407 --> 00:23:42,974
Moo.

451
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:43,728
Yes?

452
00:23:44,097 --> 00:23:47,840
You’re all dressed up. Are you waiting for someone?

453
00:23:49,139 --> 00:23:50,174
How do you know?

454
00:23:51,139 --> 00:23:52,336
I’m waiting for my mom.

455
00:23:54,366 --> 00:23:54,880
Your mom?

456
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:55,534
Yes.

457
00:23:56,111 --> 00:23:56,734
She’ll be here soon.

458
00:23:58,810 --> 00:24:00,086
Then who is going with Kang?

459
00:24:00,086 --> 00:24:00,646
Kang?

460
00:24:01,292 --> 00:24:03,053
No. It’s nothing.

461
00:24:04,876 --> 00:24:05,860
I got to go.

462
00:24:05,860 --> 00:24:07,123
- Bye.
- Okay. Bye.

463
00:24:09,909 --> 00:24:10,649
Kang!

464
00:24:14,802 --> 00:24:16,062
Is that Shone’s car?

465
00:24:18,216 --> 00:24:18,957
Moo.

466
00:24:20,434 --> 00:24:21,194
Oh, hi, Mom.

467
00:24:21,632 --> 00:24:22,327
You’re here.

468
00:24:22,327 --> 00:24:23,307
You’re early.

469
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:25,733
You came down to wait for me?

470
00:24:26,194 --> 00:24:27,161
Yes.

471
00:24:27,807 --> 00:24:28,742
I was waiting for you.

472
00:24:30,814 --> 00:24:31,574
Is something wrong?

473
00:24:32,814 --> 00:24:33,869
No, nothing.

474
00:24:33,869 --> 00:24:35,033
Let me help you with your stuff.

475
00:24:35,995 --> 00:24:37,326
How are you, Mom?

476
00:24:37,796 --> 00:24:39,381
Did you come from the studio or home?

477
00:24:39,381 --> 00:24:40,079
Home.

478
00:24:40,460 --> 00:24:42,968
Don’t be shocked once you enter the room.

479
00:24:43,302 --> 00:24:45,141
Why? What’s in there?

480
00:24:45,141 --> 00:24:48,266
Nothing. I just want you to prepare yourself.

481
00:24:53,484 --> 00:24:54,429
Guys.

482
00:24:54,683 --> 00:24:55,600
This is my mom.

483
00:24:59,864 --> 00:25:01,520
Hi, Mom.

484
00:25:02,339 --> 00:25:02,965
Hi.

485
00:25:03,196 --> 00:25:04,316
Hi guys.

486
00:25:08,871 --> 00:25:09,615
Sorry.

487
00:25:10,261 --> 00:25:11,794
I’m Potae.

488
00:25:11,921 --> 00:25:13,298
I’m Payos.

489
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,174
We’re Moo’s best friends.

490
00:25:16,139 --> 00:25:17,298
That’s right.

491
00:25:17,506 --> 00:25:19,378
Our exam is coming up

492
00:25:19,378 --> 00:25:24,553
so I invited them to come over and study together.

493
00:25:24,727 --> 00:25:27,488
We help one another with any questions we can’t solve.

494
00:25:37,043 --> 00:25:39,920
Then I’ll come back another day.

495
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:41,466
You guys should continue studying.

496
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:42,560
I don’t want to interrupt.

497
00:25:42,675 --> 00:25:43,659
Hold on, Mom.

498
00:25:46,312 --> 00:25:47,522
Please don’t go, Mom.

499
00:25:47,522 --> 00:25:50,240
We had no idea you were coming today.

500
00:25:50,240 --> 00:25:52,811
Otherwise, we wouldn’t have come here to study today.

501
00:25:52,851 --> 00:25:54,221
We’d have come tomorrow instead.

502
00:25:56,360 --> 00:25:58,444
We’re sorry, Mom.

503
00:25:59,344 --> 00:26:00,680
Please accept our apologies, Mom.

504
00:26:00,680 --> 00:26:01,434
Yes.

505
00:26:02,487 --> 00:26:03,558
That’s enough.

506
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:05,714
You don’t need to apologize to me.

507
00:26:05,899 --> 00:26:08,512
I just wanted to visit Moo.

508
00:26:08,512 --> 00:26:10,403
I wanted to see how he’s doing

509
00:26:10,404 --> 00:26:13,465
and what kind of friends he’s hanging out with.

510
00:26:13,748 --> 00:26:19,560
But after seeing this, I…

511
00:26:22,698 --> 00:26:23,896
You feel relieved, right?

512
00:26:26,920 --> 00:26:28,400
I think it’s a bit weird.

513
00:26:31,293 --> 00:26:32,552
How is it weird, Mom?

514
00:26:33,909 --> 00:26:36,120
I’ve never seen my son like this.

515
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:41,226
I’ve changed.

516
00:26:41,734 --> 00:26:46,762
People change to become a better and more responsible person.

517
00:26:47,233 --> 00:26:48,034
Right, friends?

518
00:26:48,034 --> 00:26:48,841
Yes.

519
00:26:49,246 --> 00:26:51,246
Time changes, people change.

520
00:26:51,491 --> 00:26:52,477
That’s right.

521
00:26:54,346 --> 00:26:55,360
Sure.

522
00:26:55,659 --> 00:26:58,819
I won’t take any more of your study time.

523
00:27:00,342 --> 00:27:03,033
Let me go and buy some food for you to eat while you study.

524
00:27:03,656 --> 00:27:04,567
I’ll be right back, Moo.

525
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:05,782
Please don’t be long.

526
00:27:08,297 --> 00:27:10,013
Safe trip, Mom.

527
00:27:10,290 --> 00:27:11,499
Thank you so much, Mom.

528
00:27:18,642 --> 00:27:20,959
Shall we revise chemistry next?

529
00:27:20,959 --> 00:27:22,320
Let’s do 30 practice questions.

530
00:27:26,542 --> 00:27:27,564
She’s gone.

531
00:27:29,765 --> 00:27:31,479
This place is a space for artsy kids.

532
00:27:31,479 --> 00:27:33,414
They regularly hold workshops here.

533
00:27:34,021 --> 00:27:36,021
Different kinds each week.

534
00:27:36,954 --> 00:27:40,080
Today, they’re having a ceramic workshop.

535
00:27:40,469 --> 00:27:42,240
I think you’ll get some content.

536
00:27:42,634 --> 00:27:43,418
Thank you so much.

537
00:27:51,921 --> 00:27:54,920
Press your hands down like this.

538
00:27:54,961 --> 00:27:55,590
How are you doing?

539
00:27:55,590 --> 00:27:56,746
The clay is so hard.

540
00:27:59,440 --> 00:28:00,749
I’m shaping a dish.

541
00:28:01,440 --> 00:28:02,131
Wow.

542
00:28:02,774 --> 00:28:03,584
That’s beautiful.

543
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:12,418
Do I pull it or step on it?

544
00:28:12,558 --> 00:28:13,574
You can step on it.

545
00:28:14,128 --> 00:28:15,112
Ah.

546
00:28:16,064 --> 00:28:17,152
Yes. There you go.

547
00:28:26,528 --> 00:28:28,528
I don’t know what you guys like to eat

548
00:28:28,911 --> 00:28:30,118
so I bought a lot of things.

549
00:28:34,820 --> 00:28:39,500
Guys, before we eat, shall we recite the periodic table?

550
00:28:39,929 --> 00:28:40,684
Yes.

551
00:28:40,684 --> 00:28:42,336
That’s a very good idea, friend.

552
00:28:43,534 --> 00:28:44,120
Li?

553
00:28:44,120 --> 00:28:44,766
Lithium.

554
00:28:44,766 --> 00:28:45,360
Na?

555
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:45,917
Sodium.

556
00:28:45,917 --> 00:28:46,417
K?

557
00:28:46,417 --> 00:28:46,917
Potassium.

558
00:28:46,917 --> 00:28:47,820
Rb? Rubidium.

559
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:48,393
Cs?

560
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:49,480
What is that? I can’t remember.

561
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:50,047
It’s easy to memorize.

562
00:28:50,047 --> 00:28:51,379
Only two syllables.

563
00:28:51,379 --> 00:28:54,428
Remember, it starts C- with and ends with -sium.

564
00:28:54,428 --> 00:28:54,928
Oh.

565
00:28:54,928 --> 00:28:55,433
Cesium.

566
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,071
Uh-huh.

567
00:28:56,235 --> 00:28:57,545
What’s Fr?

568
00:28:57,545 --> 00:28:58,657
F is for Fran.

569
00:28:58,657 --> 00:28:59,563
Fanmeet?

570
00:28:59,563 --> 00:29:00,330
Franchise.

571
00:29:00,330 --> 00:29:00,832
Francium.

572
00:29:00,832 --> 00:29:02,385
Oh!

573
00:29:02,743 --> 00:29:04,254
Studying together is worth it.

574
00:29:07,832 --> 00:29:08,552
Potae.

575
00:29:09,106 --> 00:29:09,754
Yes?

576
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:12,586
What faculty do you want to get into?

577
00:29:13,033 --> 00:29:14,722
I want to go to a med school.

578
00:29:14,722 --> 00:29:15,687
So does Payos.

579
00:29:18,655 --> 00:29:24,840
Dream Camp For Young Aspiring Doctors.

580
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:31,669
There’s a preparation camp coming up soon

581
00:29:31,669 --> 00:29:33,318
and Moo is interested.

582
00:29:33,481 --> 00:29:34,477
Yes, I am.

583
00:29:34,477 --> 00:29:36,240
I heard there’ll be famous tutors there.

584
00:29:37,018 --> 00:29:41,885
If a child says they want to study medicine, no parents will say no.

585
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:42,944
Oh.

586
00:29:43,552 --> 00:29:44,272
Go for it.

587
00:29:44,853 --> 00:29:45,587
That’s good.

588
00:29:45,927 --> 00:29:47,926
Just put this paper in front

589
00:29:47,926 --> 00:29:51,215
and write whatever to fill it up.

590
00:29:52,105 --> 00:29:55,660
The last page is the letter you want your mom to sign.

591
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:56,400
Right here.

592
00:29:58,009 --> 00:29:59,539
Your idea is really good, Tae.

593
00:29:59,539 --> 00:30:00,092
Yeah.

594
00:30:02,685 --> 00:30:03,751
It’s amazing.

595
00:30:04,949 --> 00:30:06,868
Could you please sign a document for me?

596
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:10,361
Where is it?

597
00:30:11,076 --> 00:30:11,783
Potae, buddy.

598
00:30:11,783 --> 00:30:12,397
Oh, yes.

599
00:30:12,397 --> 00:30:13,071
Could you pass this to her?

600
00:30:13,196 --> 00:30:14,267
Sure.

601
00:30:15,072 --> 00:30:16,088
Here it is, Mom.

602
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:19,200
But what if she reads the document?

603
00:30:19,786 --> 00:30:21,679
Come on, Moo.

604
00:30:21,679 --> 00:30:22,671
Don’t you ever watch TV dramas?

605
00:30:23,046 --> 00:30:24,722
All executives do is sign.

606
00:30:24,722 --> 00:30:25,806
I’ll act as one.

607
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,019
Mr. Executive, I need you to sign this document.

608
00:30:28,234 --> 00:30:29,221
Which page?

609
00:30:29,221 --> 00:30:29,728
You can just sign it here.

610
00:30:29,728 --> 00:30:30,449
Okay.

611
00:30:32,702 --> 00:30:33,638
Let me read through it first.

612
00:30:33,638 --> 00:30:35,281
(Shit. He said she wouldn’t read it.)

613
00:30:35,281 --> 00:30:36,189
Excuse me, Mom.

614
00:30:36,564 --> 00:30:39,573
Overall, it just gives you the background of the camp.

615
00:30:39,573 --> 00:30:40,705
That’s it.

616
00:30:40,800 --> 00:30:44,250
But I guarantee that participants will benefit from it.

617
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:46,220
We can confirm the benefits.

618
00:30:46,452 --> 00:30:47,976
These two have joined the camp before.

619
00:30:50,479 --> 00:30:51,765
Which page do I need to sign?

620
00:30:51,980 --> 00:30:52,583
The pen.

621
00:30:55,680 --> 00:30:56,461
Here you are.

622
00:30:58,641 --> 00:30:59,169
Right here.

623
00:31:15,510 --> 00:31:16,201
Thank you.

624
00:31:16,510 --> 00:31:17,226
Thank you.

625
00:31:18,352 --> 00:31:22,232
The camp is going to be so much fun, Mom.

626
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:24,434
Yay.

627
00:31:25,381 --> 00:31:25,997
Alright.

628
00:31:26,480 --> 00:31:27,800
Now that I’ve already signed it,

629
00:31:28,354 --> 00:31:31,227
it’s time for you to tell the truth.

630
00:31:31,996 --> 00:31:33,078
All three of you.

631
00:31:38,853 --> 00:31:39,922
What truth?

632
00:31:42,013 --> 00:31:43,119
It’s nothing.

633
00:31:43,529 --> 00:31:45,118
It’s nothing, Mom.

634
00:31:45,398 --> 00:31:48,482
Did you really think I’d believe your med school camp story?

635
00:31:50,752 --> 00:31:51,252
Hmm?

636
00:31:54,685 --> 00:31:55,336
Tell me.

637
00:32:03,381 --> 00:32:04,506
Thank you so much, Kang.

638
00:32:04,989 --> 00:32:06,051
I got a lot of footage.

639
00:32:06,051 --> 00:32:06,624
You’re welcome.

640
00:32:07,054 --> 00:32:08,137
Do you come here often?

641
00:32:08,512 --> 00:32:12,904
I used to come here a lot, but not anymore.

642
00:32:13,762 --> 00:32:14,344
Why not?

643
00:32:16,096 --> 00:32:19,986
Well, I used to come here to get tutored for art school.

644
00:32:20,308 --> 00:32:22,812
Then I quit and didn’t take the exam.

645
00:32:26,703 --> 00:32:30,419
It’s a pity you couldn’t continue in this area.

646
00:32:30,808 --> 00:32:33,240
You looked happy doing artwork.

647
00:32:36,843 --> 00:32:37,354
Shall we go?

648
00:32:37,872 --> 00:32:38,396
Yes.

649
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:44,909
Did you think you could fool me by just wearing glasses and reading books?

650
00:32:45,696 --> 00:32:47,526
I’ve raised you for years, Moo.

651
00:32:47,794 --> 00:32:49,618
Of course, I could tell you were lying.

652
00:32:50,458 --> 00:32:53,290
You were faking it so badly.

653
00:32:53,600 --> 00:32:55,220
I could tell from the first glance

654
00:32:55,631 --> 00:32:58,689
but I wanted to know how far you’d go.

655
00:32:59,249 --> 00:33:01,070
Sorry.

656
00:33:02,137 --> 00:33:02,856
Mom,

657
00:33:03,428 --> 00:33:06,380
our clip passed the audition.

658
00:33:06,684 --> 00:33:09,556
I don’t want to lose this opportunity.

659
00:33:10,128 --> 00:33:11,942
I gave you an ultimatum

660
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:15,032
but you didn’t care at all?

661
00:33:15,032 --> 00:33:16,066
I did.

662
00:33:17,360 --> 00:33:19,897
I studied hard to improve my grades.

663
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,328
I showed you I could do it.

664
00:33:23,883 --> 00:33:26,292
I don’t want to see you hurt again.

665
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:28,111
You’ve tried so many times.

666
00:33:28,204 --> 00:33:31,920
Every time you fail the auditions, you don't know why.

667
00:33:32,128 --> 00:33:33,324
But I do.

668
00:33:33,699 --> 00:33:35,636
I know how the industry is.

669
00:33:36,011 --> 00:33:39,574
I see you get hurt over and over again.

670
00:33:39,574 --> 00:33:41,075
Do you think that makes me feel good?

671
00:33:42,362 --> 00:33:43,280
Mom.

672
00:33:43,620 --> 00:33:45,127
I really want to do this.

673
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,367
I want to accomplish it with my own talent.

674
00:33:47,850 --> 00:33:53,305
If I end up failing or losing, I’ll accept it.

675
00:33:54,008 --> 00:33:56,723
This time, please let me do it.

676
00:33:57,031 --> 00:33:58,103
Please give me a chance.

677
00:33:58,103 --> 00:34:02,724
Moo, I already gave you permission when I signed the letter

678
00:34:03,564 --> 00:34:06,447
because I saw that you really worked harder in school.

679
00:34:09,240 --> 00:34:10,188
But

680
00:34:11,261 --> 00:34:15,113
this will be your last chance.

681
00:34:16,543 --> 00:34:18,382
If you fail this time,

682
00:34:19,949 --> 00:34:23,862
I’ll send you to live with your dad in New Zealand after you finish high school.

683
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:38,643
Today was so much fun.

684
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:39,997
See you.

685
00:34:47,903 --> 00:34:48,705
Hey, Kang.

686
00:34:49,077 --> 00:34:50,275
You’re back.

687
00:34:50,682 --> 00:34:52,320
- Yes.
- How was it? Did you have fun?

688
00:34:52,320 --> 00:34:53,572
I had so much fun.

689
00:34:53,953 --> 00:34:56,378
I got to shape clay for the first time.

690
00:34:56,378 --> 00:34:58,848
At first, I thought it was going to be hard but it wasn’t at all.

691
00:34:59,150 --> 00:35:02,240
I can’t wait to see how it turns out after firing.

692
00:35:02,593 --> 00:35:04,062
I’ll get it in a few days.

693
00:35:06,776 --> 00:35:08,776
Do you want to get back to studying art?

694
00:35:13,515 --> 00:35:18,290
I know that you feel guilty about your Dad and me so you made that decision.

695
00:35:19,219 --> 00:35:20,431
But you know what?

696
00:35:21,175 --> 00:35:25,457
I feel guilty about you too for ignoring your dream.

697
00:35:29,812 --> 00:35:30,855
No, Mom.

698
00:35:31,705 --> 00:35:33,415
I made that decision on my own.

699
00:35:37,242 --> 00:35:40,259
It’s been over two years that you’ve been helping me.

700
00:35:42,782 --> 00:35:44,624
I want you to decide again.

701
00:35:46,085 --> 00:35:51,184
I want you to follow your dream and your happiness.

702
00:35:53,177 --> 00:35:55,048
I want to see you happy.

703
00:35:58,022 --> 00:35:58,752
Okay?

704
00:36:01,620 --> 00:36:02,321
Okay.

705
00:36:24,036 --> 00:36:24,771
Hello?

706
00:36:25,620 --> 00:36:26,405
It’s me.

707
00:36:26,750 --> 00:36:28,844
Oh, what’s up, Moo?

708
00:36:30,761 --> 00:36:33,292
Hey, I got the signature.

709
00:36:33,653 --> 00:36:34,777
Mom signed it for me.

710
00:36:35,081 --> 00:36:35,765
See?

711
00:36:36,376 --> 00:36:38,120
There was no need for me to act as your parent.

712
00:36:38,306 --> 00:36:38,884
You’re right.

713
00:36:39,472 --> 00:36:42,640
But where did you go today and with whom?

714
00:36:48,814 --> 00:36:49,779
How did you know?

715
00:36:50,814 --> 00:36:52,081
I saw Neth this morning.

716
00:36:52,373 --> 00:36:54,414
She thought I was going on a date with you.

717
00:36:54,653 --> 00:36:56,135
So where did you go and with whom?

718
00:36:56,719 --> 00:36:58,600
I…went to do some errands.

719
00:36:58,600 --> 00:36:59,720
What errands? With whom?

720
00:37:01,045 --> 00:37:02,449
Someone asked me to be a tour guide.

721
00:37:02,449 --> 00:37:03,231
Where?

722
00:37:03,364 --> 00:37:04,041
The art center.

723
00:37:04,041 --> 00:37:04,655
What did you do there?

724
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:05,277
Ceramic pottery.

725
00:37:05,277 --> 00:37:06,089
Why are you angry?

726
00:37:06,089 --> 00:37:07,157
I’m not.

727
00:37:07,157 --> 00:37:08,360
Why are you making a big fuss about this?

728
00:37:08,761 --> 00:37:09,880
You nag me more than my mom.

729
00:37:09,880 --> 00:37:11,240
Why haven’t you taken me there?

730
00:37:11,240 --> 00:37:14,207
You’ve been to many places with me, haven’t you?

731
00:37:14,431 --> 00:37:15,609
It’s not the same.

732
00:37:15,609 --> 00:37:16,962
We’ve never dated.

733
00:37:16,962 --> 00:37:17,858
Take me on a date.

734
00:37:17,858 --> 00:37:19,904
Take me on a date and be like a couple.

735
00:37:19,904 --> 00:37:21,322
We can’t be like a couple

736
00:37:23,699 --> 00:37:25,280
but we can go on a date.

737
00:37:26,088 --> 00:37:26,957
Really?

738
00:37:29,028 --> 00:37:30,159
Can we really do that?

739
00:37:30,957 --> 00:37:31,792
Just leave.

740
00:37:31,792 --> 00:37:32,612
Please stop already.

741
00:37:34,263 --> 00:37:35,404
Let me see your nails.

742
00:37:38,383 --> 00:37:39,484
Why are they so long?

743
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:40,749
I’ll take care of them.

744
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:41,522
No need.

745
00:37:41,522 --> 00:37:42,240
Kang.

746
00:37:43,090 --> 00:37:43,951
Don’t be stubborn.

747
00:37:49,661 --> 00:37:51,428
Why don’t you sit in front of me?

748
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:53,608
I’m more comfortable like this.

749
00:37:53,953 --> 00:37:54,862
This is like cutting my own nails.

750
00:38:00,122 --> 00:38:01,511
Don’t cut my skin.

751
00:38:02,397 --> 00:38:03,368
I won’t.

752
00:38:06,422 --> 00:38:07,451
By the way,

753
00:38:08,372 --> 00:38:12,072
there’s something I haven’t told you.

754
00:38:14,430 --> 00:38:16,696
My mom gave me one condition.

755
00:38:17,903 --> 00:38:21,652
If I fail the audition this time, when I finish high school,

756
00:38:23,113 --> 00:38:25,177
I’ll have to go live with my dad in New Zealand.

757
00:38:30,143 --> 00:38:31,915
I’m scared I’ll fail.

758
00:38:39,563 --> 00:38:41,417
You can do it for sure.

759
00:38:42,612 --> 00:38:44,469
I’m always rooting for you here.

760
00:38:51,901 --> 00:38:52,706
Thank you.

761
00:39:02,708 --> 00:39:04,080
[New Wave Project Participation Confirmation Letter]

762
00:39:21,973 --> 00:39:23,071
Hey, bro.

763
00:39:23,682 --> 00:39:24,960
Did you call to borrow my money?

764
00:39:25,172 --> 00:39:27,255
No, Mom already gave me money.

765
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:29,695
I wanted to ask if you know the insides of the New Wave Project.

766
00:39:29,695 --> 00:39:32,921
What do they want to see in the audition?

767
00:39:32,921 --> 00:39:35,085
How many people are they looking for?

768
00:39:35,085 --> 00:39:36,083
No idea.

769
00:39:37,056 --> 00:39:39,800
So, you’re going?

770
00:39:40,542 --> 00:39:41,713
Did your mom come around?

771
00:39:41,713 --> 00:39:44,842
She did, but she gave me a harsh condition.

772
00:39:45,080 --> 00:39:49,327
She said if I don’t win this, she’ll send me to live with Dad in New Zealand.

773
00:39:49,327 --> 00:39:50,370
That’s good.

774
00:39:50,503 --> 00:39:51,785
You’ll get to improve your language skills.

775
00:39:51,785 --> 00:39:53,831
I don’t want to improve my language skills.

776
00:39:54,043 --> 00:39:55,575
I want to debut here.

777
00:39:55,575 --> 00:39:59,836
Besides, the person I’m pursuing just started giving me a chance.

778
00:40:00,128 --> 00:40:02,180
Love is such a big drive in your life, huh?

779
00:40:02,180 --> 00:40:05,226
Come on. Let me see his face.

780
00:40:05,226 --> 00:40:06,042
No.

781
00:40:06,573 --> 00:40:08,077
We’re not together yet.

782
00:40:08,236 --> 00:40:10,804
Don’t steal him from me. I know what you’re trying to do.

783
00:40:10,804 --> 00:40:12,358
I’m not going to steal him from you.

784
00:40:12,358 --> 00:40:14,744
I already have eyes on someone else.

785
00:40:14,744 --> 00:40:15,630
Oh?

786
00:40:15,630 --> 00:40:16,617
Who is it?

787
00:40:16,936 --> 00:40:18,623
I’m not sure how things will go yet.

788
00:40:18,623 --> 00:40:21,058
Once I am, I’ll introduce him to you.

789
00:40:21,270 --> 00:40:22,836
Come on.

790
00:40:22,969 --> 00:40:23,811
I got to go.

791
00:40:23,811 --> 00:40:24,709
I need to edit my video.

792
00:40:24,709 --> 00:40:26,096
Okay. Bye.

Let’s call it a night.

800
00:40:59,364 --> 00:41:00,053
No more.

801
00:41:01,035 --> 00:41:02,858
Don’t sit like this, Tae.

802
00:41:02,858 --> 00:41:03,727
Or you’re going to get cramps.

803
00:41:04,437 --> 00:41:06,437
What? I’ll be fine.

804
00:41:06,437 --> 00:41:07,828
Let me help you cool down.

805
00:41:08,698 --> 00:41:10,698
Hold your ankles.

806
00:41:10,698 --> 00:41:12,209
That’s going to hurt so bad.

807
00:41:14,601 --> 00:41:15,943
Just hold your ankles.

808
00:41:19,661 --> 00:41:21,043
1, 2, 3.

809
00:41:21,627 --> 00:41:22,832
That’s enough.

810
00:41:23,841 --> 00:41:26,243
Guys, I’m going to practice some more.

811
00:41:26,243 --> 00:41:27,699
I feel like my moves still need some work.

812
00:41:28,124 --> 00:41:29,401
Look, Moo.

813
00:41:29,401 --> 00:41:32,354
I understand that the stakes are very high

814
00:41:32,354 --> 00:41:34,058
but we’ve been practicing for five days already.

815
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:35,209
We haven’t gotten any rest.

816
00:41:35,209 --> 00:41:36,241
Take some rest.

817
00:41:36,374 --> 00:41:37,378
You’re right.

818
00:41:38,344 --> 00:41:39,919
You guys can go home.

819
00:41:39,919 --> 00:41:40,930
I’m going to practice some more.

820
00:41:40,930 --> 00:41:42,106
You guys seem exhausted.

821
00:41:44,594 --> 00:41:45,729
We’re leaving then.

822
00:41:45,729 --> 00:41:46,355
Yeah.

823
00:41:46,626 --> 00:41:49,210
See you.

824
00:41:50,410 --> 00:41:51,385
My leg is sprained.

825
00:41:51,704 --> 00:41:52,729
Ouch!

826
00:41:53,373 --> 00:41:54,497
- Let’s go.
- Can you get my stuff?

827
00:41:58,923 --> 00:42:01,560

Kang, what are you doing here?

833
00:42:14,754 --> 00:42:16,064
Why did you turn off the music?

834
00:42:17,795 --> 00:42:18,976
You’ve practiced a lot already.

835
00:42:18,976 --> 00:42:19,795
Take some rest.

836
00:42:20,941 --> 00:42:23,074
No, I’m not dancing well enough.

837
00:42:23,724 --> 00:42:25,724
I don’t want to fail.

838
00:42:25,724 --> 00:42:26,712
You won’t.

839
00:42:26,712 --> 00:42:28,308
All this dancing is stuck in your brain by now.

840
00:42:28,517 --> 00:42:31,124
Let’s find something else to do and relax

841
00:42:31,124 --> 00:42:32,486
so you’ll feel refreshed tomorrow.

842
00:42:34,212 --> 00:42:36,106
Just the two of us?

843
00:42:36,265 --> 00:42:37,015
Yeah.

844
00:42:39,485 --> 00:42:42,000
Are you asking me on a date?

845
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,120
Do you want to go or not?

846
00:42:44,446 --> 00:42:45,432
Of course.

847
00:42:45,432 --> 00:42:46,040
Let’s go.

848
00:42:50,673 --> 00:42:51,903
Wow.

849
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:53,220
This place is amazing.

850
00:42:53,220 --> 00:42:54,293
It’s nice and cool.

851
00:42:54,293 --> 00:42:55,808
I used to come here a lot.

852
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:57,604
I loved coming here to draw.

853
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:00,611
Yes, I remember you’re good at drawing.

854
00:43:00,903 --> 00:43:01,823
I wonder…

855
00:43:03,974 --> 00:43:05,136
Why I don’t go to university?

856
00:43:07,372 --> 00:43:08,310
Yeah.

857
00:43:09,685 --> 00:43:14,255
Actually, I planned to try for painting school two years ago.

858
00:43:14,892 --> 00:43:16,591
My dad was supportive

859
00:43:16,830 --> 00:43:19,724
even though my mom didn’t agree with that choice.

860
00:43:20,786 --> 00:43:21,461
Dad.

861
00:43:21,461 --> 00:43:21,964
Hmm?

862
00:43:22,240 --> 00:43:23,640
I want a tablet.

863
00:43:23,640 --> 00:43:27,986
Are you serious about getting into art school?

864
00:43:28,543 --> 00:43:32,350
But later, I didn’t continue my studies because

865
00:43:37,369 --> 00:43:39,385
my dad had an accident.

866
00:43:40,240 --> 00:43:45,765
I never picked up the tablet he gave me again.

867
00:43:47,916 --> 00:43:51,343
No wonder you wouldn’t accept my tablet.

868
00:43:52,553 --> 00:43:55,119
I’m sorry.

869
00:43:55,544 --> 00:43:56,230
Hey,

870
00:43:57,133 --> 00:43:58,765
it’s not your fault.

871
00:43:59,296 --> 00:44:00,458
You know what?

872
00:44:01,945 --> 00:44:07,193
Your determination gives me a lot to think about.

873
00:44:08,096 --> 00:44:12,589
I think I’ll get my dad’s tablet fixed.

874
00:44:13,990 --> 00:44:18,830
And I’ve researched what universities in Bangkok offer painting courses.

875
00:44:20,025 --> 00:44:22,863
I think I still have time to submit my portfolio.

876
00:44:24,403 --> 00:44:26,455
You’re going to study in Bangkok?

877
00:44:27,490 --> 00:44:29,118
You have to pass your audition.

878
00:44:29,814 --> 00:44:31,177
New Zealand is far.

879
00:44:32,350 --> 00:44:34,345
Bangkok is as far as I can follow you.

880
00:44:36,815 --> 00:44:37,814
Okay.

881
00:44:38,690 --> 00:44:41,577
Hearing this makes me want to win even more.

882
00:44:42,240 --> 00:44:42,991
Let’s make a promise.

883
00:44:44,903 --> 00:44:45,895
I promise.

884
00:44:58,030 --> 00:44:58,696
Tae.

885
00:45:00,635 --> 00:45:01,863
I’m lonely.

886
00:45:02,447 --> 00:45:03,576
Tae, what’s wrong?

887
00:45:30,052 --> 00:45:31,242
Am I crying?

888
00:45:32,280 --> 00:45:33,075
Yes.

889
00:45:34,270 --> 00:45:35,465
Bad dream?

890
00:45:41,493 --> 00:45:42,894
I dreamed that I got to debut,

891
00:45:44,381 --> 00:45:45,779
but no one came to watch me.

892
00:45:47,903 --> 00:45:49,498
No one cared about me.

893
00:45:56,774 --> 00:45:57,787
It’s okay.

894
00:45:58,637 --> 00:46:02,418
If you tell your family, they’ll come to support you.

895
00:46:03,666 --> 00:46:04,948
I’m not sure about that.

896
00:46:06,249 --> 00:46:07,773
They never care about me.

897
00:46:09,446 --> 00:46:10,569
Please don’t leave me.

898
00:46:12,561 --> 00:46:14,357
I’ll go with you to the finish line.

899
00:46:28,581 --> 00:46:31,294
I got so much encouragement from you today.

900
00:46:31,745 --> 00:46:33,758
I’m definitely going to pass the audition tomorrow.

901
00:46:35,033 --> 00:46:35,843
Yeah.

902
00:46:36,135 --> 00:46:37,587
I have something for you.

903
00:46:38,145 --> 00:46:39,080
What is it?

904
00:46:39,770 --> 00:46:40,635
What?

905
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:41,627
Here.

906
00:46:42,025 --> 00:46:44,255
This is your lucky charm from me.

907
00:46:44,706 --> 00:46:47,053
You made this for me?

908
00:46:48,407 --> 00:46:49,255
Give me your hand.

909
00:46:57,620 --> 00:46:59,938
I just wanted to do something for you too.

910
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:05,473
This is so cute.

911
00:47:06,031 --> 00:47:08,869
I think you have to bless it.

912
00:47:08,869 --> 00:47:09,963
Otherwise, it won’t be powerful.

913
00:47:10,282 --> 00:47:11,441
Come on. Bless it for me.

914
00:47:16,858 --> 00:47:19,246
A pat ti yae, a pat ti tae tae na.

915
00:47:19,246 --> 00:47:19,904
Abracadabra!

916
00:47:21,179 --> 00:47:22,129
You’re all set.

917
00:47:22,687 --> 00:47:23,609
Seriously?

918
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:29,078
I think in addition to the blessing, you have to place your magic too.

919
00:47:29,370 --> 00:47:30,216
What?

920
00:47:30,216 --> 00:47:31,186
Place your magic.

921
00:47:31,876 --> 00:47:32,779
What are you doing?

922
00:47:34,777 --> 00:47:37,866
This is how you can place your magic on my face.

923
00:47:40,657 --> 00:47:41,568
Come on.

924
00:47:47,925 --> 00:47:52,587
♪ I know you don’t like if I call you my boo ♪

925
00:47:52,587 --> 00:47:57,604
♪ Then what word can express how much I cherish you ♪

926
00:47:57,604 --> 00:47:58,465
Done.

927
00:47:58,465 --> 00:47:59,995
Go get ‘em.
♪ Maybe I’ll just replace it with your name ♪

928
00:48:00,473 --> 00:48:01,257
I will.

929
00:48:01,257 --> 00:48:02,935
♪ My boo is you, it’s the same ♪

930
00:48:02,935 --> 00:48:08,640
♪ I want to call you boo, but only your name now should do ♪

931
00:48:20,800 --> 00:48:23,433
(Here comes the day I go after my dream.)

932
00:48:23,433 --> 00:48:24,213
Go get ‘em.

933
00:48:24,213 --> 00:48:25,266
I’m rooting for you.

934
00:48:25,425 --> 00:48:27,408
I got here because of you, Kang.

935
00:48:27,408 --> 00:48:28,816
I think we’ll definitely pass.

936
00:48:29,028 --> 00:48:29,855
Trust me.

937
00:48:30,280 --> 00:48:31,606
How long have you been crushing on him?

938
00:48:31,606 --> 00:48:32,835
Nonsense.

939
00:48:32,835 --> 00:48:34,245
You’re going to get it from me.

940
00:48:34,590 --> 00:48:36,368
I’m here for you.

941
00:48:37,921 --> 00:48:39,068
Which Moo is cuter?

942
00:48:40,422 --> 00:48:41,781
Can I hit on you?

943
00:48:42,392 --> 00:48:44,585
Kang, do you love me?

944
00:48:46,231 --> 00:48:47,240
Will you be my boyfriend?

945
00:48:47,710 --> 00:48:50,294
(Just you wait, I’m getting a boyfriend!)

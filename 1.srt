Hey, make sure I arrive in time.

11
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,293
Yes, you’ll get there in time.

12
00:00:52,293 --> 00:00:53,416
Hold on tight.

13
00:00:53,416 --> 00:00:53,916
Okay.

14
00:00:57,331 --> 00:00:58,457
Watch out!

15
00:01:10,723 --> 00:01:11,848
Keep going.

00:01:11,848 --> 00:01:12,656

Go get ‘em.

20
00:01:24,987 --> 00:01:25,840
I will.

21
00:01:28,187 --> 00:01:28,959
Can you take this?

22
00:01:28,959 --> 00:01:29,534
I have to go.

23
00:01:29,534 --> 00:01:30,034

25
00:01:34,459 --> 00:01:35,884
Give me a hug. I need some encouragement.

26
00:01:41,165 --> 00:01:42,000
I’m going now.

27
00:01:42,587 --> 00:01:43,406

00:03:39,259 --> 00:03:40,779
I’m giving him 10 more minutes.

Hi.

49
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:08,005
Are you ready?

50
00:04:08,312 --> 00:04:09,035
I am.

51
00:04:09,314 --> 00:04:10,705
(This is me, Moo.)

00:04:10,705 --> 00:04:12,680
(An ordinary guy who dreams of becoming an idol.)

53
00:04:13,525 --> 00:04:16,480
(Clearly, the journey to my dream is no bed of roses.)

54
00:04:17,823 --> 00:04:19,739
(It's a bed of thorns.)

55
00:04:21,085 --> 00:04:24,650
(For as long as I can remember, I’ve loved dancing.)

56
00:04:24,650 --> 00:04:29,224
(I got my inspiration from being on stage and seeing the audience clap for me.)

57
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:31,360
(I discovered my dream in life.)

58
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:32,668
(My dream is to dance.)

59
00:04:33,151 --> 00:04:35,039
(You think I’m the center of attention?)

60
00:04:36,435 --> 00:04:37,904
(I’m just an extra dancer.)

61
00:04:42,275 --> 00:04:45,763
(Something always gets in the way of reaching my dream.)

62
00:04:46,853 --> 00:04:50,426
(But wait and see, this time I’ll make it happen.)

63
00:05:01,295 --> 00:05:02,611
I’m hearing back so quickly. I definitely passed.

64
00:05:07,831 --> 00:05:08,919
What the hell?
[You did not pass the contest.]

65
00:05:08,919 --> 00:05:10,393
I even randomly guessed the answers and left the exam.
Moo.

66
00:05:10,393 --> 00:05:11,872
[You did not pass the contest.]

67
00:05:15,869 --> 00:05:16,592
Moo.

68
00:05:21,817 --> 00:05:22,662
Yes, Mom.

69
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,629
Why did you only get back now?

70
00:05:27,277 --> 00:05:28,891
I went to tutoring classes after the exam.

71
00:05:29,884 --> 00:05:30,738
Many subjects.

72
00:05:31,728 --> 00:05:33,825
Are you sure you went to tutoring classes?

73
00:05:34,887 --> 00:05:35,561
Yes.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:36,722
Give it to me.

75
00:05:38,342 --> 00:05:39,717
Give me your backpack.

76
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:42,000
Mom.

77
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:42,958
Give it.

78
00:05:51,632 --> 00:05:52,370
What subject is this?

79
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,297
Physics.

80
00:05:54,380 --> 00:05:55,071
Chemistry.

81
00:05:55,993 --> 00:05:56,743
Biology.

82
00:05:58,644 --> 00:05:59,566
Biology?

83
00:05:59,566 --> 00:06:00,840
You better learn not to lose your life.

84
00:06:01,229 --> 00:06:03,564
You skipped school to audition again, didn’t you?

85
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:04,481
No, Mom.

86
00:06:17,730 --> 00:06:18,538
Thank you.

87
00:06:18,678 --> 00:06:20,094
You did really great.

88
00:06:20,521 --> 00:06:22,640
I think you have a bright future ahead of you.

89
00:06:23,162 --> 00:06:26,280
Our team will get back to you.

90
00:06:27,046 --> 00:06:28,348
I didn’t want to lie to you

91
00:06:29,128 --> 00:06:32,153
but if I pass this audition, I’ll get to become an idol for sure.

92
00:06:32,712 --> 00:06:37,495
You’re so afraid of failing the audition that you’re willing to fail the exam?

93
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:38,813
How did you know that?

94
00:06:41,361 --> 00:06:43,277
Let’s talk about how you did your exam

95
00:06:43,277 --> 00:06:45,545
because you’re not interested in being smart.

96
00:06:46,724 --> 00:06:48,000
The teacher called me.

97
00:06:48,480 --> 00:06:50,480
Prepare to retake the exam.

98
00:06:50,592 --> 00:06:53,235
If you don’t pass this subject, you won’t graduate.

99
00:06:56,504 --> 00:07:00,000
Moo, if you keep ignoring your studies like this,

100
00:07:00,432 --> 00:07:02,097
you’ll regret it one day.

101
00:07:04,182 --> 00:07:06,853
Studies can be your plan B.

102
00:07:07,388 --> 00:07:08,941
But I don’t want a plan B.

103
00:07:09,191 --> 00:07:11,024
My only goal is to become an idol.

104
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,440
It’s my fault for being too easy on you that you got used to it.

105
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:23,328
I let this go on for too long that you became so stubborn.

106
00:07:23,524 --> 00:07:26,414
Your grades have been dropping since you started grade 10.

107
00:07:26,414 --> 00:07:29,370
You’re now in the first semester of grade 12 and they’re not getting better.

108
00:07:30,404 --> 00:07:34,306
I guess I have to give you a harsh punishment this time.

109
00:07:43,191 --> 00:07:46,285
Mom, are you really going to punish me this way?

110
00:07:46,440 --> 00:07:47,247
Yes.

111
00:07:47,247 --> 00:07:49,070
You will move to a school out of town.

112
00:07:49,070 --> 00:07:51,939
You will live far away you can’t skip school and go dancing anywhere.

113
00:07:52,218 --> 00:07:53,040
Grab that.

114
00:07:55,052 --> 00:07:56,594
And this semester…

115
00:07:56,957 --> 00:07:57,874
Careful.

116
00:07:58,321 --> 00:08:03,000
And if you ignore your studies this semester and fail to get into university,

117
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,280
you can forget about dancing.

118
00:08:10,255 --> 00:08:12,400
Mom, tell me honestly.

119
00:08:14,404 --> 00:08:15,845
Why don’t you want me to dance?

120
00:08:16,989 --> 00:08:18,989
Because I love you.

121
00:08:19,237 --> 00:08:20,560
I’m in the industry.

122
00:08:20,732 --> 00:08:22,732
Outsiders think it’s beautiful

123
00:08:22,973 --> 00:08:25,160
but it’s actually not pleasant to be in.

124
00:08:25,278 --> 00:08:28,060
You’d have to sacrifice a lot more than you think.

125
00:08:28,767 --> 00:08:29,766
Trust me.

126
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:31,815
You can’t be an idol forever.

127
00:08:32,178 --> 00:08:36,205
When you turn 30, 40, and 50, your time is up.

128
00:08:36,903 --> 00:08:37,746
Mom,

129
00:08:38,724 --> 00:08:41,073
I don’t know what I want to be at those ages

130
00:08:41,744 --> 00:08:46,352
but I know what I want to be now.

131
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,299
No more talking.

132
00:08:50,495 --> 00:08:51,681
It’s just one semester.

133
00:08:51,681 --> 00:08:55,075
Go and study there so there’s no entertainment to distract you.

134
00:08:55,075 --> 00:08:59,257
Just focus on doing well in school and passing the university admission exam.

135
00:08:59,257 --> 00:09:00,746
That’s enough.

136
00:09:00,746 --> 00:09:01,440
End of story.

137
00:09:02,472 --> 00:09:03,375
Mom.

138
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:05,563
You won’t change your mind no matter what I say, right?

139
00:09:09,161 --> 00:09:12,360
If your dream is really important to you,

140
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,485
you must do what I ask.

141
00:09:15,009 --> 00:09:20,027
Consider this one of the tests you have to pass to reach your dream.

142
00:09:21,905 --> 00:09:23,123
Get in the car.

143
00:09:39,104 --> 00:09:40,062
Thank you so much.

144
00:09:40,062 --> 00:09:41,635
Ride safe.

145
00:09:41,635 --> 00:09:42,517
I will.

146
00:09:43,002 --> 00:09:43,940
See you around.

147
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:50,040
Oh, Kang!

148
00:09:50,040 --> 00:09:53,077
Why did it take you more than two hours to come back from the market?

149
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:54,379
What took you so long?

150
00:09:54,379 --> 00:09:56,794
We might not be able to finish preparing the food in time for sale.

151
00:09:57,226 --> 00:09:59,226
I ran into Auntie Pu at the market.

152
00:09:59,226 --> 00:10:01,255
I saw she had been waiting for a ride for a long time.

153
00:10:01,396 --> 00:10:04,514
I’m rich and have a lot of gas, so.

154
00:10:06,372 --> 00:10:07,785
Okay, philanthropist.

155
00:10:08,118 --> 00:10:10,818
Go and wash the vegetables before I smack you.

156
00:10:10,818 --> 00:10:11,884
Yes, Mom.

157
00:10:11,884 --> 00:10:13,702
Can you manage?

158
00:10:13,702 --> 00:10:14,753
Yes.

159
00:10:15,368 --> 00:10:16,512
Smack me.

160
00:10:24,573 --> 00:10:25,623
Is that ready?

161
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:45,508
I’ll be back.

162
00:10:45,508 --> 00:10:46,016
Okay.

163
00:10:53,072 --> 00:10:54,273
Here’s your food, Uncle Auan.

164
00:10:54,664 --> 00:10:58,120
And please let your daughter eat this for nourishment.

165
00:10:58,120 --> 00:10:59,382
I prepared it especially for her.

166
00:10:59,661 --> 00:11:00,700
Thank you, Mr. Kang.

167
00:11:02,712 --> 00:11:03,673
Hey, Kang.

168
00:11:03,673 --> 00:11:04,366
Hey, Neth.

169
00:11:05,010 --> 00:11:05,976
Hello, Miss Neth.

170
00:11:06,451 --> 00:11:07,625
Hi, Uncle Auan.

171
00:11:08,097 --> 00:11:09,426
I’m going to eat if you don’t mind.

172
00:11:14,282 --> 00:11:15,478
Come here.

173
00:11:15,478 --> 00:11:16,589
Come here!

174
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:18,007
What is it, Neth?

175
00:11:20,290 --> 00:11:23,156
My dad doesn’t pay him a small salary.

176
00:11:23,574 --> 00:11:25,462
You don’t have to give him food every day.

177
00:11:27,359 --> 00:11:29,219
But he still makes less money than us.

178
00:11:29,855 --> 00:11:30,768
It’s fine.

179
00:11:31,080 --> 00:11:32,167
It’s no big deal.

180
00:11:32,167 --> 00:11:32,978
My family happens to be rich.

181
00:11:33,586 --> 00:11:35,280
Okay, rich kid.

182
00:11:35,280 --> 00:11:37,300
You give him one meal a day which costs 40 baht.

183
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:38,393
The total per month is 1200 baht.

184
00:11:38,393 --> 00:11:39,316
That’s not a small amount of money.

185
00:11:39,527 --> 00:11:42,000
It’s only 40 baht to make the world a nicer place.

186
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:42,691
It’s worth it.

187
00:11:43,302 --> 00:11:44,447
How noble you are.

188
00:11:44,894 --> 00:11:45,819
Of course, I am.

189
00:11:46,853 --> 00:11:47,845
What’s wrong with you?

190
00:12:04,843 --> 00:12:07,458
Mom, is this really Nakhon Pathom?

191
00:12:07,855 --> 00:12:09,520
I haven’t seen Phra Pathom Chedi.

192
00:12:09,993 --> 00:12:11,267
We didn’t pass Jae Kaek’s either.

193
00:12:13,195 --> 00:12:16,173
You said we’d arrive in no time

194
00:12:16,173 --> 00:12:18,466
but you’d been speeding for 3 hours.

195
00:12:18,630 --> 00:12:19,932
This is the right place.

196
00:12:20,388 --> 00:12:24,000
You’ll be far away from all the city distractions and only focus on your studies.

197
00:12:47,638 --> 00:12:49,778
Are you sure there’s a school around here?

198
00:12:49,966 --> 00:12:51,631
Yes. It’s not far.

199
00:12:51,631 --> 00:12:52,538
You can walk there.

200
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:54,828
Just head that way.

201
00:12:56,278 --> 00:12:57,058
That way?

202
00:12:57,337 --> 00:12:58,110
Yes.

203
00:12:58,891 --> 00:13:00,891
Are you sure you’re not punishing me too harshly?

204
00:13:00,891 --> 00:13:01,909
Harshly?

205
00:13:01,909 --> 00:13:04,240
I chose what’s best for you.

206
00:13:04,559 --> 00:13:06,640
I went to this school too back in the day.

207
00:13:07,069 --> 00:13:09,640
I graduated and became quite successful.

208
00:13:10,526 --> 00:13:12,526
I walked to school.

209
00:13:12,526 --> 00:13:16,618
While walking, I recited vocabulary and the periodic table.

210
00:13:17,055 --> 00:13:18,058
It was so good.

211
00:13:19,064 --> 00:13:21,229
Don’t make that face.

212
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,578
Nowadays is so much better than back then.

213
00:13:23,578 --> 00:13:30,000
When I booked the dorm, the owner said a convenience store was only a 20-minute walk.

214
00:13:30,512 --> 00:13:33,400
Back in my days, it took me an hour to go shopping in the city.

215
00:13:34,570 --> 00:13:35,460
You’ll be fine, right?

216
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:37,644
Yes. I’ll be totally fine.

217
00:13:37,644 --> 00:13:38,559
No sweat.

218
00:13:39,341 --> 00:13:40,324
Definitely no sweat.

219
00:13:40,938 --> 00:13:41,771
I’m leaving then.

220
00:13:41,771 --> 00:13:43,315
Okay. Bye.

221
00:13:44,308 --> 00:13:45,224
See you.

222
00:13:45,224 --> 00:13:46,057
Bye-bye.

223
00:13:46,057 --> 00:13:46,981
Come visit me.

224
00:13:47,262 --> 00:13:49,262
I’ll have to check my schedule.

225
00:13:58,850 --> 00:13:59,764
I’m leaving now.

226
00:14:00,267 --> 00:14:01,185
You’re leaving now?

227
00:14:01,399 --> 00:14:02,148
I’m leaving.

228
00:14:02,539 --> 00:14:03,790
Okay. Bye.

229
00:14:04,547 --> 00:14:05,510
Love you.

230
00:14:07,360 --> 00:14:09,922
When I run out of toothpaste, I have to travel 20 minutes?

231
00:14:12,604 --> 00:14:14,273
These are so damn heavy.

232
00:14:18,855 --> 00:14:19,667
Hi.

233
00:14:20,757 --> 00:14:22,582
My mom called and booked a room.

234
00:14:24,000 --> 00:14:26,601
Oh, you’re moving in, right?

235
00:14:26,601 --> 00:14:27,403
Yes.

236
00:14:27,738 --> 00:14:28,557
Just a moment.

237
00:14:31,432 --> 00:14:32,066
The key.

238
00:14:32,401 --> 00:14:33,800
5th floor. Room 501.

239
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,290
When you arrive on your floor, your room will be to your left.

240
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:37,008
No noise after 10 p.m.

241
00:14:37,008 --> 00:14:37,778
That’s it.

242
00:14:39,147 --> 00:14:40,050
Thank you.

243
00:14:42,093 --> 00:14:43,354
Where’s the elevator?

244
00:14:44,943 --> 00:14:45,935
There’s none.

245
00:14:46,382 --> 00:14:47,390
Take the stairs.

246
00:14:48,166 --> 00:14:49,061
5th floor?

247
00:14:49,061 --> 00:14:49,583
Yes.

248
00:14:49,583 --> 00:14:50,166
5th floor.

249
00:14:50,166 --> 00:14:51,078
It’s only the 5th floor.

250
00:14:51,411 --> 00:14:52,297
Oh.

251
00:14:52,632 --> 00:14:53,746
Will you be alright, kid?

252
00:14:53,746 --> 00:14:55,081
If not, keep going anyway.

253
00:15:16,159 --> 00:15:17,461
This is easy. It’s only 5 floors.

254
00:15:22,235 --> 00:15:23,023
It’s easy!

255
00:15:26,990 --> 00:15:28,593
Only one floor to go. It’s easy!

256
00:15:31,350 --> 00:15:32,508
What did I bring?

257
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:41,090
Shit.

258
00:15:41,090 --> 00:15:41,802
This is the Zen way.

259
00:15:41,802 --> 00:15:42,733
So minimal.

260
00:15:44,604 --> 00:15:46,604
Hey, this is too minimal.

261
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,709
(What an absolute crap.)

262
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:51,635
(This is the only entertainment left in my life.)

263
00:15:54,746 --> 00:15:56,746
(People in the past could live without the internet.)

264
00:15:57,105 --> 00:15:58,138
(I’ll survive too.)

265
00:15:58,585 --> 00:15:59,636
You can do it, Mok.

266
00:16:01,399 --> 00:16:03,874
(Luckily, I was careful and didn’t forget my shower cream.)

267
00:16:05,423 --> 00:16:06,784
But I didn’t bring my shampoo.

268
00:16:08,432 --> 00:16:10,816
Come on. I can do a 20-minute workout.

269
00:16:18,906 --> 00:16:20,410
Shit. There’s no tissue paper.

270
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,152
There’s no water.

271
00:16:33,557 --> 00:16:35,658
3 trips are enough. I’m not going there again.

272
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,574
I have no toothbrush.

273
00:16:40,965 --> 00:16:42,404
Why am I so forgetful?

274
00:16:45,403 --> 00:16:46,586
[Mommy Kai’s Rice and Curry]
[Catering Service Available for Events and Ceremonies at Affordable Prices]

275
00:16:46,586 --> 00:16:49,114
These are 50 each for 2 with a side of eggs.

276
00:16:49,310 --> 00:16:50,653
It’ll be 100 baht as usual.

277
00:16:50,653 --> 00:16:52,611
The water is free.

278
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:53,784
Here’s 100 baht exact.

279
00:16:53,784 --> 00:16:54,359
Thanks.

280
00:16:54,359 --> 00:16:55,526
Please come again.

281
00:16:55,526 --> 00:16:57,036
My mom asked me to give you an offering envelope.

282
00:16:57,036 --> 00:16:57,698
Thanks.

283
00:16:57,698 --> 00:16:59,361
I’ve received many envelopes this month.

284
00:16:59,361 --> 00:17:01,199
Please come again.

285
00:17:03,694 --> 00:17:05,415
Mom, you can leave it there. I’ll do it.

286
00:17:05,415 --> 00:17:06,205
No need.

287
00:17:06,709 --> 00:17:07,772
Keep drawing.

288
00:17:07,772 --> 00:17:08,709
I’ll clean up myself.

289
00:17:08,709 --> 00:17:09,969
Here.

290
00:17:10,572 --> 00:17:11,925
Can you put this in a drawer?

291
00:17:12,121 --> 00:17:13,690
I’ll lie down a bit.

292
00:17:24,450 --> 00:17:25,556
Excuse me.

293
00:17:43,721 --> 00:17:44,640
Excuse me.

294
00:17:59,366 --> 00:17:59,986
Hmm?

295
00:18:00,766 --> 00:18:02,351
Do you have a toothbrush for sale?

296
00:18:08,066 --> 00:18:11,172
You want to buy a toothbrush at a rice and curry restaurant?

297
00:18:15,124 --> 00:18:16,136
It’s okay if you don’t have it.

298
00:18:16,413 --> 00:18:17,055
I have it.

299
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:19,457
Just a moment.

300
00:18:21,992 --> 00:18:23,256
It’s surprisingly available.

301
00:18:38,418 --> 00:18:38,996
Here.

302
00:18:41,277 --> 00:18:42,009
Thank you.

303
00:18:43,576 --> 00:18:44,480
How much is this?

304
00:18:44,481 --> 00:18:45,423
2 million.

305
00:18:45,423 --> 00:18:47,057
Huh? 2 million?

306
00:18:47,511 --> 00:18:49,373
If you don’t have that much money, you don’t have to pay.

307
00:18:51,321 --> 00:18:53,183
A toothbrush shouldn’t cost as much as 2 million.

308
00:18:53,983 --> 00:18:54,639
Stop.

309
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:55,776
Don’t move.

310
00:19:25,817 --> 00:19:26,551
It’s just a mosquito.

311
00:19:29,178 --> 00:19:30,444
You startled me.

312
00:19:30,782 --> 00:19:32,252
You could’ve told me there was a mosquito.

313
00:19:32,252 --> 00:19:33,147
I would’ve slapped it.

314
00:19:33,348 --> 00:19:34,303
Why would you slap it?

315
00:19:35,248 --> 00:19:35,878
You can just shoo it away.

316
00:19:37,799 --> 00:19:40,122
Can I help you with anything else?

317
00:19:42,827 --> 00:19:44,435
Is there a bicycle shop around here?

318
00:19:47,112 --> 00:19:49,112
(What? He looks like he doesn’t want to tell me.)

319
00:19:51,630 --> 00:19:53,169
Damn! This is so far.

320
00:19:53,992 --> 00:19:55,061
I thought he said it was around here.

321
00:20:01,468 --> 00:20:02,606
What’s wrong with my internet?

322
00:20:10,393 --> 00:20:11,532
Which way do I go next?

323
00:20:15,725 --> 00:20:16,586
I don’t know.

324
00:20:18,847 --> 00:20:19,441
It’s hot.

325
00:20:21,792 --> 00:20:22,473
Oh, hey.

326
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:25,591
I thought you said it was around here.

327
00:20:26,029 --> 00:20:26,845
I can’t find it.

328
00:20:27,165 --> 00:20:28,945
I knew you would get lost.

329
00:20:28,945 --> 00:20:29,480
Get on.

330
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:30,897
Are you giving me a ride?

331
00:20:30,897 --> 00:20:32,475
I guess I rode here to say hi.

332
00:20:32,475 --> 00:20:34,001
Hurry up. It’s hot.

333
00:20:34,001 --> 00:20:34,640
Thank you.

334
00:20:41,708 --> 00:20:43,178
Oh, this really is a bicycle shop.

335
00:20:44,192 --> 00:20:45,601
I told you it was nearby.

336
00:20:52,929 --> 00:20:54,047
Thank you.

337
00:20:54,047 --> 00:20:55,362
You’re so kind.

338
00:20:56,169 --> 00:20:56,923
No.

339
00:20:57,015 --> 00:20:57,949
This will be 2 million.

340
00:20:58,272 --> 00:20:59,758
Plus another 2 million for the toothbrush from earlier.

341
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,568
You’re kidding, right?

342
00:21:08,294 --> 00:21:09,001
I didn’t expect you to believe it.

343
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:11,308
You should smile a lot.

344
00:21:11,755 --> 00:21:13,317
You look so cute when you smile.

345
00:21:15,189 --> 00:21:16,636
Why is my face your problem?

346
00:21:17,136 --> 00:21:18,156
Just go in.

347
00:21:18,386 --> 00:21:19,504
I’ll wait outside.

348
00:21:20,449 --> 00:21:21,054
Okay.

349
00:21:29,909 --> 00:21:31,586
I look kinda cute when I smile.

350
00:21:37,699 --> 00:21:38,708
Here you go.

351
00:21:38,708 --> 00:21:40,621
Thank you.

352
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:45,491
What do you think?

353
00:21:46,090 --> 00:21:47,143
This is so cool, isn’t it?

354
00:21:47,738 --> 00:21:49,520
If you want to look cool, let me know.

355
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:50,823
I’ll let you borrow it.

356
00:21:51,192 --> 00:21:52,278
Do you even know how to ride it?

357
00:21:52,901 --> 00:21:53,645
Yes.

358
00:21:55,811 --> 00:21:56,814
Can your feet touch the ground?

359
00:21:56,814 --> 00:21:57,871
Of course.

360
00:22:07,794 --> 00:22:09,978
I’m not going to fall off.

361
00:22:16,446 --> 00:22:19,320
Hey, hey, hey!

362
00:22:19,320 --> 00:22:22,579
Hey!

363
00:22:33,123 --> 00:22:33,963
I’m sorry.

364
00:22:33,963 --> 00:22:35,123
I should be the one to say sorry.

365
00:22:35,123 --> 00:22:36,185
Why would you say sorry?

366
00:22:36,185 --> 00:22:36,939
It was an accident.

367
00:22:36,939 --> 00:22:38,091
But you apologized to me first.

368
00:22:38,091 --> 00:22:38,814
That’s true.

369
00:22:40,365 --> 00:22:41,398
I was a bit too careless.

370
00:22:41,490 --> 00:22:42,180
I’m not used to this.

371
00:22:42,543 --> 00:22:43,292
Off you go.

372
00:22:43,937 --> 00:22:44,701
I can’t go.

373
00:22:44,816 --> 00:22:45,708
You’re holding my hands.

374
00:22:48,760 --> 00:22:50,038
I have to go take care of something.

375
00:22:50,476 --> 00:22:51,613
Do you remember the way back?

376
00:22:52,175 --> 00:22:53,358
Yes, I’ll be totally fine.

377
00:22:54,175 --> 00:22:54,992
Be careful though.

378
00:22:54,992 --> 00:22:55,915
My bike is powerful.

379
00:22:56,608 --> 00:22:57,392
You might not be able to keep up.

380
00:23:07,993 --> 00:23:11,537
It was an accident. It was an accident.

381
00:23:11,766 --> 00:23:12,291
It was an accident.

382
00:23:12,729 --> 00:23:13,420
Let’s go.

383
00:23:21,677 --> 00:23:22,543
Hey, what are you doing?

384
00:23:23,677 --> 00:23:25,157
Shrimp Paste Fried Rice?

385
00:23:25,569 --> 00:23:26,300
Cute.

386
00:23:27,936 --> 00:23:28,744
Me?

387
00:23:29,822 --> 00:23:30,766
I meant the picture.

388
00:23:33,324 --> 00:23:36,408
If only you’d started school this year, you’d do well.

389
00:23:36,972 --> 00:23:38,373
Stop talking about this.

390
00:23:38,735 --> 00:23:40,090
I made my decision a long time ago.

391
00:23:42,088 --> 00:23:43,581
Kang,

392
00:23:43,581 --> 00:23:44,748
come help me carry…

393
00:23:45,261 --> 00:23:45,949
- Okay.
- Neth!

394
00:23:46,410 --> 00:23:47,215
Have you eaten?

395
00:23:47,346 --> 00:23:48,931
Not yet, Mom. I’m hungry.

396
00:23:49,121 --> 00:23:50,468
Let me fix you up.

397
00:23:50,952 --> 00:23:52,525
Don’t cook for her, Mom,

398
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:53,923
or she’ll eat up all the rice in the cooker.

399
00:23:54,061 --> 00:23:54,880
This one is a greedy eater.

400
00:23:55,157 --> 00:23:56,687
You’re so mean to your friend.

401
00:23:57,033 --> 00:23:58,381
Can I have two fried eggs?

402
00:23:58,381 --> 00:23:59,401
You got it.

403
00:24:04,079 --> 00:24:06,733
By the way, where did you go?

404
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,093
I dropped someone off at the bicycle shop.

405
00:24:11,573 --> 00:24:12,338
Who?

406
00:24:12,800 --> 00:24:14,035
I don’t know.

407
00:24:14,366 --> 00:24:18,962
He randomly walked in here and asked if I had a toothbrush for sale.

408
00:24:19,640 --> 00:24:22,383
Then he also asked me if there’s a bicycle shop nearby.

409
00:24:26,669 --> 00:24:29,234
Oh, the Asian-looking boy, right?

410
00:24:29,234 --> 00:24:29,820
Yes.

411
00:24:30,142 --> 00:24:31,291
He’s my new tenant.

412
00:24:31,600 --> 00:24:32,919
He’s from Bangkok.

413
00:24:32,919 --> 00:24:34,108
His mom just dropped him off this morning.

414
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:36,024
But it seems to me

415
00:24:36,342 --> 00:24:37,697
his mom sent him here to discipline him.

416
00:24:37,806 --> 00:24:38,986
He looks like a troublemaker.

417
00:24:39,640 --> 00:24:40,677
Discipline?

418
00:24:41,391 --> 00:24:44,206
When I met him, he didn’t seem like a bad person.

419
00:24:44,640 --> 00:24:47,946
Oh, you innocent guy.

420
00:24:48,213 --> 00:24:51,780
Even you, who seem like a good guy, have a bad mouth.

421
00:24:52,001 --> 00:24:53,069
You’re no different.

422
00:24:54,001 --> 00:24:54,933
Neth.

423
00:24:55,101 --> 00:24:55,708
Neth, dear

424
00:24:55,708 --> 00:24:56,208
Yes?

425
00:24:56,208 --> 00:24:56,840
Your rice is ready.

426
00:24:56,840 --> 00:24:57,742
It’s warm and nice.

427
00:24:57,742 --> 00:24:58,764
Thank you, Mom.

428
00:24:58,764 --> 00:24:59,264
Come.

429
00:24:59,481 --> 00:25:00,084
See, Mom?

430
00:25:00,084 --> 00:25:01,440
She’s going to suck us dry.

431
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:02,463
2 fried eggs, right?

432
00:25:02,463 --> 00:25:03,089
Here you go.

433
00:25:03,089 --> 00:25:04,123
Can you really finish it?

434
00:25:04,123 --> 00:25:04,885
Yes, I can.

435
00:25:04,885 --> 00:25:05,509
Thank you.

436
00:25:05,509 --> 00:25:06,450
Your body is still in great shape.

437
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:18,143
[Mommy Kai’s Rice and Curry]

438
00:25:19,281 --> 00:25:20,103
Thank you.

439
00:25:34,760 --> 00:25:35,661
Why is he not back yet?

440
00:25:40,721 --> 00:25:41,380
Hey.

441
00:25:42,233 --> 00:25:43,021
What happened?

442
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,230
A frog ran in front of me.

443
00:25:45,339 --> 00:25:47,138
I veered off and the chain came off.

444
00:25:49,640 --> 00:25:50,670
I also got this wound.

445
00:25:51,657 --> 00:25:52,690
You have to live with it.

446
00:25:53,335 --> 00:25:55,135
The young frogs are impatient around here.

447
00:25:55,734 --> 00:25:57,297
They always run in front of people’s vehicles.

448
00:26:02,643 --> 00:26:03,439
Thank you.

449
00:26:03,669 --> 00:26:05,455
If it weren’t for you, I’d be in a tough situation.

450
00:26:05,854 --> 00:26:06,760
Don’t thank me.

451
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:07,854
I’m charging you for everything.

452
00:26:07,854 --> 00:26:09,368
I’ll put it on your tab later.

453
00:26:11,634 --> 00:26:12,247
Hey.

454
00:26:12,247 --> 00:26:13,496
Where are you taking my bike?

455
00:26:14,065 --> 00:26:15,760
You think you can ride in that state?

456
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:16,909
You won’t even be able to walk back.

457
00:26:22,233 --> 00:26:23,716
Why are you still sitting there?

458
00:26:24,453 --> 00:26:25,001
Get on.

459
00:26:26,107 --> 00:26:26,897
Do you want to go back to your dorm or not?

460
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:28,121
Yes.

461
00:26:45,105 --> 00:26:45,724
We’ve arrived.

462
00:26:45,954 --> 00:26:46,631
Yeah.

463
00:26:55,427 --> 00:26:56,677
How do I get this off?

464
00:27:01,816 --> 00:27:03,083
Come on. Let me help.

465
00:27:15,412 --> 00:27:19,185
Thank you for helping me and dropping me off all the way here.

466
00:27:22,642 --> 00:27:23,995
Do you have something in your room to clean your wound?

467
00:27:26,880 --> 00:27:27,655
See you later then.

468
00:27:28,208 --> 00:27:29,917
Go put your bike away.

469
00:27:29,917 --> 00:27:31,025
I’ll wait at my restaurant.

470
00:27:31,997 --> 00:27:32,688
Okay.

471
00:27:40,269 --> 00:27:41,647
You’re overreacting.

472
00:27:41,647 --> 00:27:42,747
I’ll put it away myself.

473
00:27:49,615 --> 00:27:50,739
He’s quite kind.

474
00:28:07,635 --> 00:28:09,635
Ouch. That stings.

475
00:28:15,315 --> 00:28:16,102
It will sting a bit.

476
00:28:21,564 --> 00:28:23,192
It hurts.

477
00:28:23,192 --> 00:28:24,662
Don’t move.

478
00:28:58,308 --> 00:28:59,023
Done.

479
00:29:00,244 --> 00:29:01,045
Thank you.

480
00:29:01,443 --> 00:29:02,560
If it weren’t for you, I’d be in a bad condition.

481
00:29:03,080 --> 00:29:05,292
I was just worried your wound would rot

482
00:29:05,520 --> 00:29:06,649
and you’d have to cut off your arm.

483
00:29:07,386 --> 00:29:09,205
The doctors are busy around here.

484
00:29:09,735 --> 00:29:11,071
I don’t want to give them more work.

485
00:29:17,501 --> 00:29:18,236
Hey.

486
00:29:18,236 --> 00:29:18,923
Hmm?

487
00:29:19,522 --> 00:29:20,864
Your restaurant is still open, right?

488
00:29:21,509 --> 00:29:22,236
Of course.

489
00:29:22,236 --> 00:29:23,082
Are you hungry?

490
00:29:23,912 --> 00:29:24,499
Yeah.

491
00:29:29,302 --> 00:29:30,870
Wow.

492
00:29:32,187 --> 00:29:33,303
This is my dream fried egg.

493
00:29:33,303 --> 00:29:34,619
Why are you so skilled?

494
00:29:34,940 --> 00:29:36,240
Calm down. It’s just a fried egg.

495
00:29:37,792 --> 00:29:38,905
I’m serious.

496
00:29:39,152 --> 00:29:41,894
Just by looking at it, I can tell it’s a crispy fried egg.

497
00:29:42,172 --> 00:29:42,943
Look at this.

498
00:29:44,755 --> 00:29:45,861
The egg yolk is undercooked.

499
00:29:46,108 --> 00:29:48,323
This is the correct fried egg by international standards.

500
00:29:48,570 --> 00:29:49,990
This is not a waste of being a fried egg.

501
00:29:57,788 --> 00:29:58,882
It’s so yummy.

502
00:29:59,528 --> 00:30:01,842
Did your mom leave you with a phone when you were a kid?

503
00:30:02,007 --> 00:30:03,288
Your reaction is so over the top.

504
00:30:04,050 --> 00:30:06,372
It’s just a fried egg but you rave so much about it.

505
00:30:06,372 --> 00:30:08,418
You’re not originally from Nakhon Pathom, right?

506
00:30:08,933 --> 00:30:09,527
No.

507
00:30:10,803 --> 00:30:12,084
I just moved here from Bangkok.

508
00:30:12,825 --> 00:30:14,332
I transferred here for 12th grade.

509

00:40:08,074 --> 00:40:09,052
Don’t fight!

676
00:40:11,246 --> 00:40:12,272
Nothing is going on, Mr. Security Guard.

677
00:40:13,491 --> 00:40:14,734
Hello, Director.

678
00:40:17,120 --> 00:40:17,684
Hi.

679
00:40:20,471 --> 00:40:20,971
Do I look like a security guard?

680
00:40:24,697 --> 00:40:26,903
[Pathom Pittaya School]

681
00:40:35,803 --> 00:40:36,605
Oh.

682
00:40:36,884 --> 00:40:37,424
Okay.

683
00:40:37,581 --> 00:40:38,119
Remove it.

684
00:40:39,673 --> 00:40:41,882
You’re here to study, not to look handsome, okay?

685
00:40:42,421 --> 00:40:44,682
If you want to look handsome, do that outside the school.

686
00:40:47,099 --> 00:40:50,353
Your last semester grades from your previous school weren’t very good.

687
00:40:51,239 --> 00:40:53,309
But I think I did much better than when I was in grade 11.

688
00:40:54,143 --> 00:40:56,537
2.0 is not good.

689
00:40:56,888 --> 00:40:58,041
It’s called a borderline pass.

690
00:40:58,302 --> 00:40:58,802
Got it?

691
00:40:59,227 --> 00:41:00,023
Yeah.

692
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:01,418
But it’s okay.

693
00:41:02,266 --> 00:41:04,127
Your mom has asked me to help you with this.

694
00:41:04,983 --> 00:41:07,958
Even though you’re only going to be here for one semester,

695
00:41:07,958 --> 00:41:09,841
I want you to adjust.

696
00:41:10,727 --> 00:41:15,897
I understand that a sudden change can make you feel uncomfortable

697
00:41:16,492 --> 00:41:18,875
but that’s how life is.

698
00:41:19,198 --> 00:41:21,941
Unexpected changes can happen all the time.

699
00:41:22,459 --> 00:41:24,697
This might be your first time so it’ll be a bit difficult.

700
00:41:25,594 --> 00:41:29,823
When I had to move back from New York to teach in Thailand,

701
00:41:30,202 --> 00:41:32,202
I had to adjust myself a lot too

702
00:41:32,202 --> 00:41:33,255
because I was only familiar with the English language.

703
00:41:33,418 --> 00:41:34,244
What’s See Luang in English?

704
00:41:34,244 --> 00:41:34,866
Yellow.

705
00:41:34,866 --> 00:41:35,836
Chopping knife in Thai? Ito.

706
00:41:35,836 --> 00:41:36,964
Earthen stove in Thai? Anglo.

707
00:41:37,923 --> 00:41:39,149
This is not the time to make jokes.

708
00:41:39,532 --> 00:41:40,306
I’m sorry.

709
00:41:40,306 --> 00:41:46,658
Let me tell you that all changes come with discomfort

710
00:41:47,853 --> 00:41:50,846
but do you know how I got through those times?

711
00:41:53,024 --> 00:41:53,700
I have no idea.

712
00:41:55,576 --> 00:41:58,586
You have to find happiness in change.

713
00:42:00,126 --> 00:42:04,286
That happiness will help you get through tough times.

714
00:42:05,669 --> 00:42:06,849
Remember my words.

715
00:42:10,123 --> 00:42:10,943
I will.

716
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:12,443
Thank you.

717
00:42:12,791 --> 00:42:13,586
Anything else?

718
00:42:15,225 --> 00:42:15,864
Director.

719
00:42:15,864 --> 00:42:16,364
Hmm?

720
00:42:16,486 --> 00:42:18,377
Can I borrow 200 baht?

721
00:42:18,696 --> 00:42:19,581
Oh my god.

722
00:42:44,570 --> 00:42:45,334
Hey.

723
00:42:45,978 --> 00:42:47,214
You sell rice and curry here too?

724
00:42:47,778 --> 00:42:48,349
Hey.

725
00:42:49,568 --> 00:42:50,297
You again?

726
00:42:50,715 --> 00:42:51,850
Hi, Bad-Mouth-Kind-Heart Bro.

727
00:42:52,800 --> 00:42:54,056
That’s not my name.

728
00:42:54,596 --> 00:42:55,293
What’s your name then?

729
00:42:55,293 --> 00:42:56,162
You haven’t told me.

730
00:43:00,394 --> 00:43:01,391
Who’s even called Stir-Fried Clams?

731
00:43:04,215 --> 00:43:04,945
Kang.

732
00:43:06,303 --> 00:43:07,282
My name is Kang.

733
00:43:08,527 --> 00:43:09,412
Kang.

734
00:43:11,270 --> 00:43:12,800
Let me officially introduce myself.

735
00:43:13,584 --> 00:43:14,393
My name is Mok.

736
00:43:14,724 --> 00:43:15,655
My nickname is Moo.

737
00:43:16,212 --> 00:43:18,300
Nice to meet you, bro.

738
00:43:20,060 --> 00:43:20,577
Mm.

739
00:43:22,929 --> 00:43:25,896
You have to find happiness in change.

740
00:43:26,387 --> 00:43:30,616
That happiness will help you get through tough times.

741
00:43:31,257 --> 00:43:33,257
(I found my happiness.)

742
00:43:52,106 --> 00:43:54,106
DIRECTED BY SAKON WONGSINWISES

743
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:57,329
Actually, being punished to live alone is not as hard as I thought.

744
00:43:57,449 --> 00:43:58,058
Wait.

745
00:43:58,058 --> 00:43:59,177
Do you know how to wash the dishes?

746
00:43:59,291 --> 00:44:00,397
You live alone now.

747
00:44:00,397 --> 00:44:02,280
You must learn to rely on yourself, you know?

748
00:44:02,280 --> 00:44:03,606
I have you, Kang.

749
00:44:03,606 --> 00:44:04,782
Let’s call it a day.

750
00:44:04,782 --> 00:44:05,480
I’m tired.

751
00:44:05,741 --> 00:44:06,497
Not yet.

752
00:44:06,880 --> 00:44:08,042
My moves are still awkward.

753
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:10,708
My mom gave me an ultimatum to study hard and not get distracted.

754
00:44:11,232 --> 00:44:12,605
I don’t want to hurt her feelings.

755
00:44:12,939 --> 00:44:17,253
But we can work towards dreams and reality at the same time, right?

756
00:44:17,357 --> 00:44:20,616
No one can stop your dream except yourself.

757
00:44:20,616 --> 00:44:22,171
Things are not difficult

758
00:44:22,171 --> 00:44:24,053
because you’re there for me.

You gave it your all.

171
00:08:45,747 --> 00:08:47,136
I didn’t want to make you feel bad.

172
00:08:49,198 --> 00:08:50,759
My boyfriend is so cute.

173
00:08:54,692 --> 00:08:57,958
Mr. Kang, will you dance with me?

174
00:09:00,716 --> 00:09:02,352
I’m waiting for you to hold my hand.

175
00:09:18,898 --> 00:09:19,860
Are you okay?

176
00:09:23,697 --> 00:09:24,877
I’m scared.

177
00:09:26,319 --> 00:09:27,114
Of what?

178
00:09:29,160 --> 00:09:32,993
These past few days, I’ve been so happy.

179
00:09:35,487 --> 00:09:36,775
I’m scared this will disappear.

180
00:09:39,053 --> 00:09:40,014
Come on.

181
00:09:43,728 --> 00:09:44,644
It’s okay.

182
00:09:50,111 --> 00:09:51,631
When I move to New Zealand,

183
00:09:53,501 --> 00:09:54,987
will you miss me?

184
00:09:59,831 --> 00:10:00,518
Of course.

185
00:10:01,981 --> 00:10:03,730
Just being away from you for a few hours

186
00:10:04,569 --> 00:10:06,004
after we go home,

187
00:10:07,659 --> 00:10:08,775
I miss you already.

188
00:10:12,660 --> 00:10:13,646
Right?

189
00:10:19,546 --> 00:10:20,988
When I study there for a few years,

190
00:10:22,619 --> 00:10:24,161
I’ll miss you so much.

191
00:10:26,487 --> 00:10:28,080
Don’t worry beforehand.

192
00:10:29,327 --> 00:10:33,515
Technology is advanced these days.

193
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:36,258
We can video call each other every day if you want.

194
00:10:37,457 --> 00:10:41,019
But it’s not the same as seeing you in person.

195
00:10:43,753 --> 00:10:50,821
I won’t be able to hold your hand.

196
00:10:55,617 --> 00:10:57,943
I won’t be able to hug you.

197
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:03,463
I won’t be able to feel your warmth.

198
00:11:06,774 --> 00:11:11,771
I won’t be able to smell your shirt.

199
00:11:16,279 --> 00:11:18,438
I won’t be able to kiss you on the cheek.

200
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:35,438
Don’t worry.

201
00:11:39,562 --> 00:11:43,158
I’ll make the most of our time left.

202
00:11:46,059 --> 00:11:47,333
I love you.

203
00:11:49,371 --> 00:11:50,745
I love you, too.

204
00:11:52,847 --> 00:11:54,011
I love you so much.

205
00:11:57,896 --> 00:11:59,849
I love you the most in the universe.

206
00:12:02,391 --> 00:12:03,682
Why am I crying?

207
00:12:05,879 --> 00:12:06,980
Don’t cry.

208
00:12:28,329 --> 00:12:31,667
I wish we could hold hands like this forever.

209
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:42,259
I’ll never let go of your hand.

210
00:12:46,287 --> 00:12:47,372
I promise.

211
00:12:57,896 --> 00:12:59,807
[Dance among the stars]

212
00:13:01,956 --> 00:13:02,790
Whoa.

213
00:13:03,494 --> 00:13:04,722
New Zealand?

214
00:13:05,499 --> 00:13:07,695
I thought it’d be Bangkok and another city.

215
00:13:11,509 --> 00:13:12,639
Are you okay?

216
00:13:13,149 --> 00:13:15,299
Not that distance is an obstacle,

217
00:13:15,833 --> 00:13:17,347
but he’ll be away for many years.

218
00:13:17,881 --> 00:13:18,872
It’ll be so tough.

219
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:25,420
I used to be fearful
and scared of many things,

220
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:28,227
only staying in my safe zone.

221
00:13:31,001 --> 00:13:32,736
I don’t want to be like that anymore.

222
00:13:34,048 --> 00:13:39,671
Now I know how I feel

223
00:13:43,266 --> 00:13:45,738
and I trust my feelings.

224
00:13:49,569 --> 00:13:53,351
I just want to love him like this for as long as I can.

225
00:13:55,343 --> 00:13:58,980
Yeah. I believe you can do it.

226
00:13:59,442 --> 00:14:02,532
No matter what happens, I’ll be by your side.

227
00:14:02,823 --> 00:14:05,220
I’ll be your biggest cheerleader.

228
00:14:05,803 --> 00:14:08,301
If you’re single, I’ll be single with you.

229
00:14:08,301 --> 00:14:12,124
If you’re sad and need someone to lean on, I’ll comfort you.

230
00:14:12,901 --> 00:14:16,041
But I have a boyfriend now.

231
00:14:16,041 --> 00:14:16,959
Don’t remind me.

232
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,803
I’ll catch up with you soon.

233
00:14:18,803 --> 00:14:20,499
You don’t need to brag.

234
00:14:20,499 --> 00:14:22,012
Just eat and stop talking too much.

235
00:14:24,854 --> 00:14:26,314
Thank you so much, Neth.

236
00:14:26,314 --> 00:14:27,157
Of course.

[2 Weeks Until Final Exam]

238
00:14:31,069 --> 00:14:34,628
Right now, I’m so busy with school and dancing.

239
00:14:36,814 --> 00:14:38,621
I don’t know yet.

240
00:14:38,815 --> 00:14:39,414
Tae.

241
00:14:43,374 --> 00:14:44,015
What?

242
00:14:44,404 --> 00:14:45,143
Who?

243
00:14:46,440 --> 00:14:47,261
Hello?

244
00:14:48,440 --> 00:14:49,874
Potae is busy.

245
00:14:50,286 --> 00:14:51,747
Where’s Potae?

246
00:14:52,209 --> 00:14:52,818
Where are you?

247
00:14:54,081 --> 00:14:54,929
Up to you.

248
00:14:55,103 --> 00:14:56,372
Up to you.

249
00:14:56,372 --> 00:14:57,497
If you want to ghost me, just do it!

250
00:14:57,783 --> 00:14:58,852
You jerk! Asshole!

251
00:14:58,852 --> 00:14:59,892
What did you make me do?

252
00:15:03,171 --> 00:15:03,981
She hung up.

253
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:05,328
She did?

254
00:15:05,328 --> 00:15:05,983
Yeah.

255
00:15:07,878 --> 00:15:09,000
I got scolded for nothing.

256
00:15:09,389 --> 00:15:10,424
What did she say?

257
00:15:10,424 --> 00:15:11,915
You jerk! Asshole!

258
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:14,047
Her words, not mine.

259
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:15,802
Sorry.

260
00:15:16,093 --> 00:15:16,896
Yeah.

261
00:15:17,503 --> 00:15:20,203
But what did you do to make her scold you like that?

262
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:21,740
I didn’t do anything.

263
00:15:22,007 --> 00:15:23,528
I just didn’t pick up her calls for 2 weeks.

264
00:15:23,528 --> 00:15:24,310
You deserved it.

265
00:15:24,310 --> 00:15:26,720
If you don’t want to talk to her, just say so.

266
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,426
If I knew how to say that, I would've done it already.

267
00:15:28,426 --> 00:15:29,846
How did you survive until now?

268
00:15:31,717 --> 00:15:33,120
I always asked Payos to talk to those girls

269
00:15:34,092 --> 00:15:35,255
but he’s busy today,

270
00:15:35,838 --> 00:15:38,378
so I made you do it instead when you came here just in time.

271
00:15:38,937 --> 00:15:39,947
Where’s Yos?

272
00:15:40,068 --> 00:15:41,314
Aren’t you guys always together?

273
00:15:42,237 --> 00:15:43,106
He’s in Bangkok.

I’m sorry.
[A FEW DAYS EARLIER]

I was harsh to you again.

276
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:50,996
I was just shocked.

277
00:15:53,838 --> 00:15:55,306
But I’m really happy for you.

278
00:15:56,010 --> 00:15:56,940
It’s okay.

279

What do they want you to do next?

280
00:16:04,062 --> 00:16:05,245
You’ll get some training, right?

281
00:16:09,032 --> 00:16:11,970
I’ve decided I won’t be joining.

282
00:16:12,261 --> 00:16:12,825
What?

283
00:16:15,278 --> 00:16:16,734
I don’t want to compete anymore.

284
00:16:17,171 --> 00:16:18,452
What’s wrong with you, Yos?

285
00:16:18,816 --> 00:16:20,424
Your opportunity has come.

286
00:16:20,424 --> 00:16:22,350
Are you just going to let it go so easily?

287
00:16:22,350 --> 00:16:23,915
Come on, Yos.

288
00:16:23,915 --> 00:16:24,760
If I have to do this without you,

289
00:16:25,160 --> 00:16:26,342
I don’t want it.

290
00:16:30,253 --> 00:16:33,238
I’m not as passionate about this as you.

291
00:16:33,942 --> 00:16:35,327
I don’t want to be an idol.

Why did you zone out?

I like having fun with you.

00:18:31,091 --> 00:18:34,263
You know I’ve always liked the same things as you since we were young.

It’s nothing more than that.

What about dreams?

330
00:18:43,387 --> 00:18:44,751
Don’t you have any dreams?

331

00:19:11,034 --> 00:19:12,167
Yes, I’ll do it for you.

340
00:19:13,212 --> 00:19:13,999
You promise?

341
00:19:14,558 --> 00:19:15,349
What?

342
00:19:15,811 --> 00:19:18,019
What you just said.

343
00:19:18,627 --> 00:19:19,476
Promise me.

344
00:19:19,476 --> 00:19:20,292
Alright.

345
00:19:20,754 --> 00:19:21,969
Okay.

346
00:19:23,329 --> 00:19:25,213
So he’s only doing this because you asked?

347
00:19:26,986 --> 00:19:27,846
I guess so.

348
00:19:29,304 --> 00:19:30,779
But I’m glad it’s him.

349
00:19:31,167 --> 00:19:32,772
At least, he’s my friend.

350
00:19:33,379 --> 00:19:34,687
If he gets famous,

351
00:19:35,756 --> 00:19:36,915
I can talk to him.

352
00:19:38,615 --> 00:19:40,334
I’m so bummed though.

353
00:19:40,601 --> 00:19:41,980
I love dancing

354
00:19:43,364 --> 00:19:44,905
but I’m not as good as him.

355
00:19:45,828 --> 00:19:49,168
I want to be an idol but he gets the opportunity despite not wanting it.

356
00:19:50,066 --> 00:19:51,258
The world is funny.

357
00:19:51,986 --> 00:19:53,704
Yeah, I get it.

358
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:56,561
People who work hard for something often feel pressured.

359
00:19:57,144 --> 00:20:01,934
On the other hand, people who do it just for fun always get chosen.

360
00:20:02,711 --> 00:20:05,263
Do we pressure ourselves too much?

361
00:20:06,332 --> 00:20:07,181
I think so.

362
00:20:07,472 --> 00:20:10,382
As Yos said, he just does this for fun.

363
00:20:10,941 --> 00:20:13,664
His doing this for fun almost made me go crazy.

364
00:20:14,028 --> 00:20:15,631
I had to spend a long time convincing him.

365
00:20:15,631 --> 00:20:17,202
At first, he said he wouldn’t go.

366
00:20:17,761 --> 00:20:19,412
I was so mad, you know?

367
00:20:20,505 --> 00:20:22,115
I tried so hard for the opportunity

368
00:20:23,378 --> 00:20:24,689
while he got it but didn’t want to grab it.

369
00:20:24,932 --> 00:20:27,951
That idiot. Actually, I wanted to scold him more harshly.

370
00:20:29,603 --> 00:20:30,368
Tae,

371
00:20:32,141 --> 00:20:34,768
you should speak more nicely to Yos.

372
00:20:35,885 --> 00:20:36,718
Why?

373
00:20:37,908 --> 00:20:38,922
He loves you.

374
00:20:41,205 --> 00:20:41,906
Yeah.

375
00:20:42,683 --> 00:20:43,561
I love him too.

376
00:20:45,261 --> 00:20:46,343
Now you know.

377
00:20:48,845 --> 00:20:49,525
I got to go.

378
00:20:50,254 --> 00:20:50,989
Okay.

379
00:20:54,584 --> 00:20:55,458
TTM COMPANY

380
00:20:55,604 --> 00:21:00,652
This is the contract for our trainee artists while on the New Wave Project.

381
00:21:01,429 --> 00:21:03,702
We have 8 contestants.

382
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,437
If you win and get selected to become an artist, we’ll give you another contract.

383
00:21:09,720 --> 00:21:11,239
You can read through it first.

384
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:19,607
Can I have Panang chicken curry and stir-fried vegetables?

385
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:21,318
Sure.

386
00:21:23,213 --> 00:21:24,245
Would you like anything else?

387
00:21:24,464 --> 00:21:26,778
How about an omelet or other dishes?

388
00:21:26,778 --> 00:21:29,726
I want to help my boyfriend sell food quickly so he doesn’t get tired.

389
00:21:29,726 --> 00:21:30,951
You guys are boyfriends already?

390
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,628
Yes. Did you miss the news?

391
00:21:32,871 --> 00:21:34,283
I guess.

392
00:21:34,283 --> 00:21:37,057
You know, I’ve been rooting for you two since you broadcasted

393
00:21:37,057 --> 00:21:37,741
Really?

394
00:21:37,741 --> 00:21:39,257
that song for him.

395
00:21:39,903 --> 00:21:40,859
You’re so kind.

396
00:21:41,029 --> 00:21:42,269
I’ll give you a free fried egg.

397
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:43,517
Wow.

398
00:21:43,808 --> 00:21:44,583
Thank you.

399
00:21:44,583 --> 00:21:45,760
I’ll come back and tease you again.

400
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:47,374
You two are a perfect match.

401
00:21:47,374 --> 00:21:47,996
That’s so kind.

402
00:21:47,996 --> 00:21:48,800
You get a free meal.

403
00:21:48,800 --> 00:21:49,300
Thanks for the free food.

404
00:21:49,300 --> 00:21:49,883
Of course.

405
00:21:50,417 --> 00:21:51,560
You’re my idol.

406
00:21:51,560 --> 00:21:52,984
If you want something, you work hard for it.

407
00:21:52,984 --> 00:21:54,790
If you want him to love you, you hit on him.

408
00:21:54,790 --> 00:21:56,322
That’s so sweet.

409
00:21:56,784 --> 00:21:57,354
What would you like to eat?

410
00:21:57,354 --> 00:21:57,949
This meal is on me.

411
00:21:57,949 --> 00:21:58,902
Can I have Panang curry?

412
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:00,147
Hey.

413
00:22:00,633 --> 00:22:02,343
You’re not supposed to give away food.

414
00:22:03,849 --> 00:22:04,840
I’ll treat you some other day.

415
00:22:05,034 --> 00:22:06,633
My boyfriend is strict.

416
00:22:06,852 --> 00:22:08,052
Stop talking.

417
00:22:08,246 --> 00:22:09,707
Go to class. I’ll sell food myself.

418
00:22:11,359 --> 00:22:12,310
Come on.

419
00:22:12,310 --> 00:22:14,139
I only have a few months left with you.

420
00:22:14,139 --> 00:22:15,351
Let me help you.

421
00:22:15,351 --> 00:22:18,562
This is one of the things I want to do with you.

422
00:22:18,562 --> 00:22:21,058
Help my boyfriend sell food.

423
00:22:21,520 --> 00:22:24,523
You can help me at the park this evening

424
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:27,047
so we can spend a long time together.

425
00:22:32,999 --> 00:22:34,021
Okay, boo.

426
00:22:34,507 --> 00:22:37,014
Let me return the cap to this handsome owner of the stall.

427
00:22:40,488 --> 00:22:41,533
Go.

428
00:22:41,533 --> 00:22:42,726
Help me take off my apron first.

429
00:22:42,847 --> 00:22:43,776
Turn around.

430
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:44,814
No, I’ll stand like this.

431
00:22:55,089 --> 00:22:56,364
I won’t sell to anyone who screams.

432
00:22:57,480 --> 00:22:58,554
It’s okay. I will.

433
00:22:58,554 --> 00:22:59,366
Keep screaming.

434
00:23:09,406 --> 00:23:10,490
So much for our sweet moments.

435
00:23:11,194 --> 00:23:12,344
He really killed my vibe.

436
00:23:14,263 --> 00:23:15,890
You chose to let him come along.

437
00:23:16,011 --> 00:23:18,172
No, more like he’s clinging to me.

438
00:23:18,391 --> 00:23:19,394
Now I can’t be lovey-dovey with you.

439
00:23:24,592 --> 00:23:26,481
Kang, thank you so much.

440
00:23:26,481 --> 00:23:28,766
If it wasn’t for your food, I’d have starved to death.

441
00:23:28,766 --> 00:23:30,235
Now that you’re done eating, go.

442
00:23:30,235 --> 00:23:32,057
Leave.

443
00:23:32,203 --> 00:23:33,609
Would you like some more, Tae?

444
00:23:33,609 --> 00:23:34,310
Is that enough food?

445
00:23:34,529 --> 00:23:35,523
I’m good.

446
00:23:35,523 --> 00:23:38,145
Kang, don’t tell him that. He’s a big eater.

447
00:23:40,760 --> 00:23:42,168
Tell me honestly.

448
00:23:42,945 --> 00:23:44,400
He’s so clingy to you.

449
00:23:44,866 --> 00:23:45,906
Are you dating already?

450
00:23:47,825 --> 00:23:49,240
It’s as you see it.

451
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,398
[Showing off]

452
00:23:50,398 --> 00:23:52,225
He wouldn’t leave me alone even when we weren’t dating.

453
00:23:54,460 --> 00:23:55,466
Hey, Payos.

454
00:23:55,757 --> 00:23:57,196
Our artist-to-be.

455
00:23:57,196 --> 00:23:58,502
Have a seat.

456
00:23:58,502 --> 00:23:59,965
Do you want some water? Let me get it for you.

457
00:23:59,965 --> 00:24:01,364
You don’t have to.

458
00:24:01,364 --> 00:24:02,628
You’re not troubling me. Have a seat.

459
00:24:02,628 --> 00:24:03,596
Sit down.

460
00:24:03,596 --> 00:24:04,723
How’s it going?

461
00:24:05,360 --> 00:24:06,751
Your artist aura is shining.

462
00:24:06,751 --> 00:24:07,735
Let me give you a massage.

463
00:24:07,735 --> 00:24:10,261
Just by seeing your face, I know you’re a great singer and dancer.

464
00:24:12,301 --> 00:24:13,145
How’s it going?

465
00:24:13,145 --> 00:24:15,541
What do they want you to do now that you already signed?

466
00:24:19,015 --> 00:24:21,979
I…didn’t sign it.

467
00:24:28,933 --> 00:24:29,720
I…

468
00:24:30,643 --> 00:24:32,507
I came to audition with my friends.

469
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:37,563
Passing alone would make me feel bad.

470
00:24:39,336 --> 00:24:40,538
I’m sorry.

471
00:24:40,805 --> 00:24:41,987
I’d like to withdraw from this.

472
00:24:42,206 --> 00:24:43,672
Seriously, Yos?

473
00:24:45,858 --> 00:24:48,777
Then something unexpected happened.

474
00:24:49,287 --> 00:24:51,137
Payos, don’t go yet.

475
00:24:52,546 --> 00:24:53,820
I’m really sorry

476
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,407
but my friends and I have always fought for this together.

477
00:24:57,136 --> 00:24:59,970
I don’t want to leave them behind.

478
00:25:00,626 --> 00:25:04,729
But I don’t want you and your friends’ effort to pay off anywhere else.

479
00:25:05,215 --> 00:25:06,502
If I give you another chance,

480
00:25:07,693 --> 00:25:08,894
will you give it a try?

481
00:25:10,546 --> 00:25:12,886
I want your team to audition again.

482
00:25:13,833 --> 00:25:15,115
I saw something in the three of you.

483
00:25:16,548 --> 00:25:17,336
Don’t worry.

484
00:25:20,087 --> 00:25:20,751
What?

485
00:25:20,751 --> 00:25:21,259
Are you serious?

486
00:25:23,008 --> 00:25:23,798
Woo!

487
00:25:24,089 --> 00:25:25,555
Did Jang talk to you himself?

488
00:25:25,750 --> 00:25:28,529
Yes, I can’t believe he did that either.

489
00:25:29,209 --> 00:25:29,849
Yes!

490
00:25:31,792 --> 00:25:33,441
Kang, we made it.

491
00:25:33,441 --> 00:25:34,376
We’re getting another chance.

492
00:25:34,376 --> 00:25:35,615
Congrats, Moo.

493
00:25:35,809 --> 00:25:37,110
Your opportunity has come.

494
00:25:39,200 --> 00:25:40,391
Hey.

495
00:25:40,877 --> 00:25:41,590
Hey.

496
00:25:42,026 --> 00:25:43,360
What?

497
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:44,362
You missed out on the news.

498
00:25:44,362 --> 00:25:45,570
They’re boyfriends now.

499
00:25:46,493 --> 00:25:47,448
Wow.

500
00:25:47,448 --> 00:25:48,713
My friend is something else.

501
00:25:48,713 --> 00:25:49,519
So wicked.

502
00:25:50,160 --> 00:25:51,869
Now let’s focus on our dream.

503
00:25:52,386 --> 00:25:55,299
Let’s show them all we’ve got.

504
00:25:55,785 --> 00:25:58,363
Your Everest is right in front of you, Moo.

505
00:25:58,484 --> 00:25:59,822
Don’t miss this opportunity.

506
00:25:59,822 --> 00:26:00,800
Reach the summit.

507
00:26:15,640 --> 00:26:16,441
Moo.

508
00:26:18,825 --> 00:26:20,161
Why did you bring me here?

509
00:26:20,640 --> 00:26:21,367
Shh.

510
00:26:21,613 --> 00:26:22,470
Quiet.

511
00:26:23,129 --> 00:26:24,832
No one really comes here in the early morning.

512
00:26:46,154 --> 00:26:47,934
I just finished writing this song last night.

513
00:26:49,293 --> 00:26:51,572
I plan to show the judges that I can write a song

514
00:26:53,756 --> 00:26:55,527
but I don’t want them to be the first to hear it.

515
00:26:56,218 --> 00:26:57,582
I want you to be the first to hear it

516
00:26:58,496 --> 00:27:01,898
because you’re important to this song

517
00:27:05,413 --> 00:27:07,887

These are 10 trainees fighting for their dream,

545
00:30:03,806 --> 00:30:08,639
reaching their goal to debut and become new TTM artists.
[New Wave Project 10 Finalists]

546
00:30:08,639 --> 00:30:12,134
Follow their journey on New Wave Project 2024.

547
00:30:12,134 --> 00:30:12,859
You made it.

548
00:30:12,859 --> 00:30:13,593
I made it!

549
00:30:14,395 --> 00:30:15,382
I passed, Kang.

550
00:30:15,729 --> 00:30:16,674
Well done.

551
00:30:17,560 --> 00:30:18,767
Let’s celebrate today.

552
00:30:19,079 --> 00:30:19,579
Yes.

553
00:30:19,579 --> 00:30:20,079
Let’s go.

554
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,171
I want to eat Mala hot pot.

555
00:30:21,951 --> 00:30:22,921
Count me out.

556
00:30:23,879 --> 00:30:27,796
I want to enjoy my alone time with my boyfriend.

557
00:30:27,796 --> 00:30:28,819
Right, Kang?

558
00:30:28,819 --> 00:30:29,982
Ugh.

559
00:30:31,960 --> 00:30:34,185
Hey, tell me honestly.

560
00:30:34,408 --> 00:30:35,960
Aren’t you annoyed with him?

561
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,545
No.

562
00:30:37,545 --> 00:30:38,970
I like him for who he is.

563
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:41,799
My boyfriend is the cutest.

564
00:30:42,312 --> 00:30:43,864
I can’t be here anymore.

565
00:30:44,243 --> 00:30:45,215
Love makes me want to throw up.

566
00:30:45,326 --> 00:30:46,089
Let’s go.

567
00:30:46,602 --> 00:30:47,443
I can’t stay.

568
00:30:47,443 --> 00:30:48,197
Goodbye.

569
00:30:48,554 --> 00:30:49,398
- I can’t stay.
- You lovebirds.

570
00:30:49,398 --> 00:30:49,977
Hold on.

571
00:30:50,796 --> 00:30:51,806
Don’t let us outdo you.

572
00:30:51,806 --> 00:30:52,915
Keep up. Come on.

573
00:30:52,915 --> 00:30:53,457
What?

574
00:30:53,457 --> 00:30:53,957
Come on.

575
00:30:53,957 --> 00:30:54,715
I know you know.

576
00:30:54,893 --> 00:30:55,396
What?

577
00:30:56,198 --> 00:30:57,044
Yos.

578
00:30:58,091 --> 00:30:58,791
What?

579
00:30:59,505 --> 00:31:01,232
I think it’s time to confess your feelings to Tae.

580
00:31:02,012 --> 00:31:03,518
What the hell are you on about?

581
00:31:03,785 --> 00:31:05,552
Stop talking too much or he’ll find out.

582
00:31:05,909 --> 00:31:06,808
All the better.

583
00:31:06,986 --> 00:31:08,867
He told me he loves you too.

584
00:31:09,023 --> 00:31:11,983
He also told me he loves me but as a friend.

585
00:31:11,983 --> 00:31:13,203
What don’t you understand, Moo?

586
00:31:13,359 --> 00:31:13,993
Yos!

587
00:31:14,506 --> 00:31:15,126
Hurry up!

588
00:31:15,680 --> 00:31:16,526
Give me a second.

589
00:31:17,529 --> 00:31:19,392
Don’t you want him to love you as something else?

590
00:31:19,392 --> 00:31:20,710
Shut up before he hears you.

591
00:31:20,710 --> 00:31:21,881
Hey!

592
00:31:21,881 --> 00:31:23,399
Are you two gossiping about me?

593
00:31:23,399 --> 00:31:23,955
No.

594
00:31:23,955 --> 00:31:25,253
I was just thanking Yos.

595
00:31:25,253 --> 00:31:26,840
You guys go.

596
00:31:26,840 --> 00:31:27,828
I won’t keep you any longer.

597
00:31:27,828 --> 00:31:28,711
See you. Bye.

598
00:31:28,711 --> 00:31:29,971
- See you.
- Don’t forget to tell him.

599
00:31:30,160 --> 00:31:30,728
See you, buddy.

600
00:31:30,728 --> 00:31:31,229
See you.

601
00:31:31,229 --> 00:31:32,040
Bye.

602
00:31:32,040 --> 00:31:32,873
Bye.

603
00:31:33,742 --> 00:31:35,163
I’m back.

604
00:31:41,069 --> 00:31:42,032
Is everything alright?

605
00:31:42,879 --> 00:31:43,447
You mean what happened earlier?

606
00:31:43,447 --> 00:31:43,958
Yeah.

607
00:31:45,796 --> 00:31:48,038
I was just trying to build up Yos’ courage.

608
00:31:50,823 --> 00:31:55,715
By the way, where’s the gift for my effort?

609
00:31:56,495 --> 00:31:57,361
What do you want?

610
00:31:58,364 --> 00:31:59,727
Hmm.

611
00:32:01,242 --> 00:32:01,997
This.

612
00:32:07,379 --> 00:32:08,221
Here?

613
00:32:12,944 --> 00:32:16,046
Just once, okay?

614
00:32:16,291 --> 00:32:16,791
Okay.

615
00:32:21,672 --> 00:32:22,195
Kang!

616
00:32:23,800 --> 00:32:24,374
Oh.

617
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:27,877
Am I interrupting?

618
00:32:28,390 --> 00:32:29,084
Sorry.

619
00:32:29,084 --> 00:32:30,421
I’ll come back later.

620
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:31,967
Hey, just come in.

621
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:34,041
No. Enjoy your moment.

622
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:35,282
Say what you want.

623
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:39,134
Don’t take your embarrassment out on me.

624
00:32:39,357 --> 00:32:43,351
I saw the announcement that Moo passed to the next round.

625
00:32:43,618 --> 00:32:44,977
I wanted to come here and scream with you.

626
00:32:45,490 --> 00:32:49,751
But what you just did was cute.

627
00:32:53,049 --> 00:32:55,378
Anyway, congratulations, Moo.

628
00:32:55,735 --> 00:32:57,902
Can I get your autograph now?

629
00:32:57,902 --> 00:33:00,203
In case you get famous and harder to approach in the future.

630
00:33:00,381 --> 00:33:01,180
Please.

631
00:33:01,425 --> 00:33:02,594
Give me a pen.

632
00:33:02,728 --> 00:33:03,791
I don’t have any.

633
00:33:04,125 --> 00:33:05,235
It won’t be hard to approach me.

634
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:07,935
I’ll still be the same good boy.

635
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:10,360
When you become famous, it’ll be hard to stay the same.

636
00:33:10,471 --> 00:33:14,374
Being a public figure will cost you your private life.

637
00:33:14,530 --> 00:33:15,534
Who knows?

638
00:33:15,840 --> 00:33:18,818
You might have to keep your relationship with Kang a secret.

639
00:33:21,782 --> 00:33:23,024
I don’t think so.

640
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:24,766
People are more understanding these days.

641
00:33:26,170 --> 00:33:29,469
Moo, some people aren’t.

642
00:33:29,647 --> 00:33:31,899
If you have to keep it a secret, so be it.

643
00:33:33,370 --> 00:33:34,587
Why do you say that?

644
00:33:35,506 --> 00:33:37,588
Because I’m worried about you.

645
00:33:37,922 --> 00:33:42,761
If keeping our relationship a secret is better for you, let’s do that.

646
00:33:43,296 --> 00:33:47,579
♪ Love ♪

647
00:33:48,582 --> 00:33:49,167
Look.

648
00:33:49,836 --> 00:33:53,638
We know in our hearts that we love each other.

649
00:33:54,752 --> 00:33:55,800
That’s enough.

650
00:33:57,650 --> 00:33:59,511
You’re right.

651
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:02,560
As long as the two of us know it.

652
00:34:06,393 --> 00:34:07,244
Oh!

653
00:34:07,779 --> 00:34:09,298
I feel like a third wheel here.

654
00:34:09,298 --> 00:34:11,376
Did I buy a ticket to see you crazy in love with each other?

655
00:34:11,643 --> 00:34:12,453
I can’t.

656
00:34:12,453 --> 00:34:13,137
Separate!

657
00:34:13,248 --> 00:34:15,910
Mom! Can I have something to eat?

658
00:34:19,743 --> 00:34:22,349
Yos, does my autograph look good enough?

659
00:34:23,307 --> 00:34:25,080
I think it’s time to confess your feelings to Tae.

660
00:34:26,997 --> 00:34:27,520
Yos?

661
00:34:28,969 --> 00:34:29,469
Yos?

662
00:34:30,494 --> 00:34:31,153
What?

663
00:34:32,691 --> 00:34:33,531
What were you daydreaming about?

664
00:34:35,849 --> 00:34:36,453
Nothing.

665
00:34:36,609 --> 00:34:37,401
I wasn’t daydreaming.

666
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,828
Why are you signing all that?

667
00:34:43,388 --> 00:34:44,640
I’m practicing being a celebrity

668
00:34:45,041 --> 00:34:47,427
so when my fans ask for my autograph, I can sign for them.

669
00:34:47,427 --> 00:34:48,003
Look.

670
00:34:50,165 --> 00:34:51,508
You need to practice too.

671
00:34:52,177 --> 00:34:52,716
Come on.

672
00:34:54,209 --> 00:34:55,070
I’ll keep mine.

673
00:34:59,858 --> 00:35:00,956
I’ll eat while you practice.

674
00:35:03,496 --> 00:35:06,015
Don’t you want him to love you as something else?

675
00:35:13,124 --> 00:35:14,110
Are you done?

676
00:35:14,845 --> 00:35:16,130
Let me see how you sign yours.

677
00:35:20,298 --> 00:35:20,931
Let me see.

00:45:48,904 --> 00:45:49,999
(He’s my chef.)

849
00:45:50,588 --> 00:45:51,811
(He’s my bolster.)

850
00:45:51,811 --> 00:45:53,392
(And he has soft cheeks I can kiss.)

851
00:45:53,545 --> 00:45:56,437
Can you still be my friend like you said you would?

852
00:45:56,830 --> 00:46:00,300
Out of the 10 of you here, no one knows how many of you will get to debut.

853
00:46:01,347 --> 00:46:02,472
Do your best.

854
00:46:02,472 --> 00:46:03,483
He won’t talk to me.

855
00:46:03,483 --> 00:46:04,674
He only talks to Jang.

856
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:05,920
You’re jealous.

857
00:46:07,000 --> 00:46:08,306
I’m so happy.

858
00:46:08,400 --> 00:46:12,234
Living with you feels like we’re practicing for our wedding night.

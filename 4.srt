Here’s a friendly warning.

6
00:00:20,502 --> 00:00:22,264
If you keep spending your time helping me

7
00:00:22,264 --> 00:00:23,423
instead of getting enough sleep,

8
00:00:23,423 --> 00:00:24,443
your academics are going to suffer.

9
00:00:25,832 --> 00:00:26,560
Moo!

10
00:00:29,434 --> 00:00:30,383
Moo!

11
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:34,082
Peekaboo, Kang.

12
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:36,668
Why didn't you tell me you’re sick?

13
00:00:37,366 --> 00:00:38,574
Force yourself a bit.

14
00:00:38,803 --> 00:00:40,297
Eat this so can you take your medicine afterward.

15
00:00:45,714 --> 00:00:46,776
Then what’s wrong with you?

16
00:00:48,218 --> 00:00:49,170
I like you

17
00:00:50,162 --> 00:00:53,092
and I know you like me too.

18
00:00:54,688 --> 00:00:55,507
No.

19
00:00:55,507 --> 00:00:56,357
Means yes.

20
00:00:56,357 --> 00:00:57,281
What are you talking about?

21
00:00:57,281 --> 00:00:58,132
What are you on about?

22
00:00:58,132 --> 00:00:59,356
The truth.

23
00:01:03,164 --> 00:01:05,164
ONE DAY EARLIER

24
00:01:05,601 --> 00:01:06,235
Hey.

25
00:01:06,438 --> 00:01:07,430
I need to ask you something.

26
00:01:09,057 --> 00:01:09,736
What?

27
00:01:10,143 --> 00:01:11,164
Is Kang seeing someone?

28
00:01:11,317 --> 00:01:11,992
Really?

29
00:01:11,992 --> 00:01:12,731
Yeah.

30
00:01:14,002 --> 00:01:15,190
Kang? Seeing someone?

31
00:01:15,190 --> 00:01:15,746
Yes.

32
00:01:15,746 --> 00:01:19,360
Today, my friend came into the classroom and said to Kang,

33
00:01:19,487 --> 00:01:21,409
“I saw your partner waiting at the food stall.”

34
00:01:21,409 --> 00:01:23,376
I tried to follow Kang but he wouldn’t let me.

35
00:01:23,376 --> 00:01:24,581
Don’t follow me.

36
00:01:25,534 --> 00:01:26,577
Hey, Mok.

37
00:01:26,577 --> 00:01:27,800
Can I go to the restroom first?

38
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:28,300
No.

39
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:29,989
The class is about to start.

40
00:01:29,989 --> 00:01:31,401
And the teacher made me stay in class.

41
00:01:35,445 --> 00:01:36,200
What’s wrong?

42
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:38,495
The one who went to see Kang,

43
00:01:38,495 --> 00:01:38,999
Yeah?

44
00:01:38,999 --> 00:01:40,926
That was me.

45
00:01:42,778 --> 00:01:44,477
So you and Kang are together?

46
00:01:47,260 --> 00:01:48,033
I

47
00:01:53,170 --> 00:01:54,240
am not.

48
00:01:55,368 --> 00:01:57,165
Kang and I have been close since we were kids.

49
00:01:57,165 --> 00:01:59,955
What a way to break your sentence.

50
00:02:01,859 --> 00:02:03,859
We’re close friends.

51
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:04,787
We’re always together.

52
00:02:04,937 --> 00:02:06,403
Many people ship us.

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,176
Why do you ask?

54
00:02:11,754 --> 00:02:14,161
Is it because…?

55
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:15,670
Is it because…?

56
00:02:15,670 --> 00:02:16,932
Yes.

57
00:02:18,483 --> 00:02:19,329
I like Kang.

58
00:02:19,329 --> 00:02:20,256
I knew it.

59
00:02:20,256 --> 00:02:20,944
Huh?

60
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:21,838
How did you know?

61
00:02:21,838 --> 00:02:23,866
I’m not dumb.

62
00:02:24,578 --> 00:02:25,962
I could tell from Mars.

63
00:02:27,233 --> 00:02:29,393
But why do you like him?

64
00:02:29,851 --> 00:02:30,953
You’re the first one.

65
00:02:30,953 --> 00:02:31,917
The first one?

66
00:02:31,917 --> 00:02:32,460
Yeah.

67
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:33,345
Why?

68
00:02:33,574 --> 00:02:36,395
Kang is nice,k

69
00:02:36,395 --> 00:02:37,527
ind,

70
00:02:37,709 --> 00:02:39,709
and cute.

71
00:02:40,001 --> 00:02:41,914
I thought he’d have a lot of admirers.

72
00:02:42,906 --> 00:02:43,520
Sure.

73
00:02:43,520 --> 00:02:45,297
Kang is the best.

74
00:02:45,297 --> 00:02:47,929
He’s only the best at being sharp-tongued.

75
00:02:47,929 --> 00:02:49,594
He goes around taking a jab at people.

76
00:02:49,594 --> 00:02:51,524
Some people don’t get him.

77
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:52,357
I can see it

78
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:56,252
but I still like him anyway.

79
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:00,077
What should I do, Neth?

80
00:03:01,577 --> 00:03:04,357
I think Kang is a closed-off person.

81
00:03:05,145 --> 00:03:08,292
He always does the opposite of what he says.

82
00:03:08,445 --> 00:03:11,596
If you can tolerate his sharp tongue,

83
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:12,977
he’ll come around eventually.

84
00:03:12,977 --> 00:03:14,026
Trust me.

85
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,800
Okay.

86
00:03:17,128 --> 00:03:20,145
Neth told me if you say no,

87
00:03:20,145 --> 00:03:21,456
you mean yes.

88
00:03:21,456 --> 00:03:22,948
If you tell me to go far away,

89
00:03:22,948 --> 00:03:24,072
you actually want me near.

90
00:03:24,588 --> 00:03:26,410
Don’t take your own side.

91
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:27,585
I’m not.

92
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:31,757
If you think so, can I be by your side instead?

93
00:03:32,047 --> 00:03:33,497
No, I don’t have feelings for you.

94
00:03:33,497 --> 00:03:35,360
Then I’ll flirt with you until you fall for me.

95
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:39,297
Kang,

96
00:03:40,340 --> 00:03:41,385
can I hit on you?

97
00:03:45,262 --> 00:03:47,507
Moo, listen carefully.

98
00:03:47,761 --> 00:03:49,280
You don’t actually have feelings for me.

99
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:50,407
You’re just lonely

100
00:03:50,407 --> 00:03:51,628
because you’re here alone.

101
00:03:52,823 --> 00:03:53,851
Do you understand now?

102
00:03:56,445 --> 00:03:58,603
I understand my feelings well.

103
00:03:59,773 --> 00:04:02,101
I like you because you’re kind to me.

104
00:04:02,728 --> 00:04:03,902
I like you because...

105
00:04:05,657 --> 00:04:06,825
...you’re good to me.

106
00:04:07,410 --> 00:04:11,072
I like you because you make my heart flutter.

107
00:04:11,682 --> 00:04:12,973
I like you so much.

108
00:04:14,092 --> 00:04:15,307
How are you going to take responsibility?

109
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,673
I can only take responsibility for your sickness.

110
00:04:17,876 --> 00:04:18,903
I don’t care about anything else.

111
00:04:19,022 --> 00:04:21,291
Since you’re talking this much, you must feel better already.

112
00:04:21,596 --> 00:04:24,082
Go to sleep. You might not feel this way tomorrow.

113
00:04:24,285 --> 00:04:25,000
I’m leaving.

114

EP 4: IF YOU LIKE HIM, FLIRT WITH HIM

115
00:06:07,287 --> 00:06:09,123
Since when is he close to Moo?
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

116
00:06:09,250 --> 00:06:10,956
He’s only been close with you

117
00:06:10,956 --> 00:06:12,629
and no one else.

118
00:06:12,934 --> 00:06:13,754
Well,

119
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,074
since Moo first moved here.

120
00:06:17,074 --> 00:06:19,268
The clumsy kid doesn’t know how to do anything

121
00:06:19,268 --> 00:06:22,951
so Kang helps out, being the nice guy he is.

122
00:06:23,154 --> 00:06:24,846
Don’t you know how your son is?

123
00:06:24,846 --> 00:06:25,668
Really?

124
00:06:26,202 --> 00:06:27,680
He’s only being nice and kind, right?

125
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:28,783
Yes.

126
00:06:28,936 --> 00:06:31,681
If you don’t believe me, ask Kang yourself.

127
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:33,480
Alright.

128
00:06:34,243 --> 00:06:35,331
Let me make you fried rice

129
00:06:35,487 --> 00:06:36,409
or do you want something else?

130
00:06:36,562 --> 00:06:38,536
Can I have that with two fried eggs?

131
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:40,733
Thank you.

132
00:06:48,230 --> 00:06:49,498
Let me wash that.

133
00:06:49,498 --> 00:06:50,230
What did you make?

134
00:06:51,491 --> 00:06:53,110
I made fried rice for Neth.

135
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:54,866
She stopped by for food earlier.

136
00:06:55,243 --> 00:06:57,243
You should charge her next time.

137
00:06:57,596 --> 00:06:59,612
She’s always getting away with free food.

138
00:06:59,880 --> 00:07:01,002
Neth has money.

139
00:07:01,002 --> 00:07:02,431
You don’t have to be so kind to her.

140
00:07:03,143 --> 00:07:05,424
It’s okay. Let her eat.

141
00:07:08,959 --> 00:07:09,856
By the way, Kang,

142
00:07:10,127 --> 00:07:11,850
can I ask you something?

143
00:07:12,333 --> 00:07:16,068
Is something going on between you and Moo?

144
00:07:16,960 --> 00:07:19,583
I saw you go back and forth to him.

145
00:07:20,626 --> 00:07:22,404
It’s really nothing, Mom.

146
00:07:23,014 --> 00:07:25,178
He went with me and fell into the water,

147
00:07:25,178 --> 00:07:26,776
then he got sick because of me.

148
00:07:27,201 --> 00:07:28,637
I just went to check on him.

149
00:07:29,146 --> 00:07:30,000
That’s all.

150
00:07:31,994 --> 00:07:32,685
Okay.

151
00:07:33,728 --> 00:07:38,808
But you know you can tell me anything, right?

152
00:07:40,428 --> 00:07:41,158
Yes.

Little Red Riding Hood is here.

158
00:08:03,950 --> 00:08:04,716
Did you miss me?

159

What?

160
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:06,822
Are you feeling alright now?

161
00:08:08,268 --> 00:08:09,556
I’m sick of not feeling right.

162
00:08:09,556 --> 00:08:10,849
I’d rather be your Mr. Right.

163
00:08:12,032 --> 00:08:12,978
But I guess I’m sick.

164
00:08:13,283 --> 00:08:15,480
Sick of being without you.

165
00:08:15,480 --> 00:08:17,077
When I’m physically sick, I go to a doctor.

166
00:08:17,077 --> 00:08:19,364
But what’s the diagnosis when I come to you?

167

Keep smiling.

171

00:08:57,852 --> 00:08:59,330
If your eyes are itchy, go use eye drops.

175
00:09:01,911 --> 00:09:02,979
Is this website even reliable?

176
00:09:03,767 --> 00:09:05,208
Not only are the tips not working, but I also got scolded.

177
00:09:10,112 --> 00:09:10,825
Hello?

178
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:12,102
Oh, hi, Neth.

179
00:09:12,401 --> 00:09:13,671
Huh? Someone came to see me?

180
00:09:13,976 --> 00:09:16,614
Who? You don’t know and you want me to go see for myself?

181
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:17,894
Okay.

182
00:09:34,195 --> 00:09:34,929
Hey.

183
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,239
Why are you here?

184
00:09:36,926 --> 00:09:38,131
To see your face.

185
00:09:38,843 --> 00:09:39,343
Shit.

186
00:09:39,724 --> 00:09:41,172
And check if you’re already dead.

187
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:42,693
What’s going on?

188
00:09:45,897 --> 00:09:47,899
As you can see, I’m doing fine.

189
00:09:47,899 --> 00:09:49,297
Better than the one who asked, actually.

190
00:09:49,297 --> 00:09:50,603
You moved here quietly.

191
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:52,677
Didn't you even think of contacting me?

192
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:54,785
Who disappeared first, huh?

193
00:09:55,573 --> 00:09:56,652
Are you trying to get on my nerves?

194
00:09:58,033 --> 00:09:58,811
A little.

195
00:09:58,811 --> 00:10:00,033
Do you want a piece of me?

196
00:10:00,033 --> 00:10:01,164
Come at me.

197
00:10:01,377 --> 00:10:02,690
He’s not answering my calls!

198
00:10:03,425 --> 00:10:05,120
Come at me.

199
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,126
I’m just going to get him myself.

200
00:10:06,126 --> 00:10:08,200
Come here!

201
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,047
Come at me!

202
00:10:09,047 --> 00:10:10,216
You sure you can handle it?

203
00:10:10,216 --> 00:10:11,110
Come at me.

204
00:10:11,110 --> 00:10:12,198
I’m ready.

205
00:10:20,054 --> 00:10:21,171
Hey, Moo!

206
00:10:21,171 --> 00:10:22,461
Hey, Shone!

207
00:10:23,213 --> 00:10:24,777
I’m your big bro!

208
00:10:30,397 --> 00:10:31,740
Why are you so violent, bro?

209
00:10:31,740 --> 00:10:32,951
And what was that serious face just now?

210
00:10:33,078 --> 00:10:35,000
I almost couldn’t play along in time.

211
00:10:35,562 --> 00:10:36,729
It was just a joke.

212
00:10:36,729 --> 00:10:38,273
Your mom misses you.

213
00:10:38,629 --> 00:10:39,950
You’ve been gone for like a week.

214
00:10:40,357 --> 00:10:42,434
I came to do research for my show

215
00:10:42,434 --> 00:10:44,040
so I stopped by to check on you.

216
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:44,809
She misses me?

217
00:10:45,368 --> 00:10:46,099
Yes.

218
00:10:47,261 --> 00:10:48,981
I asked her for money but she wouldn’t give it to me.

219
00:10:49,196 --> 00:10:50,713
She’s making me survive by myself.

220
00:10:50,713 --> 00:10:52,258
What do you mean she misses me?

221
00:10:52,378 --> 00:10:53,564
She’s doing the right thing.

222
00:10:54,046 --> 00:10:56,173
She gave you money for the whole month

223
00:10:56,681 --> 00:10:58,274
but you spent it all in one day.

224
00:10:58,441 --> 00:11:01,055
I spent money on what’s necessary.

225
00:11:01,055 --> 00:11:01,921
Necessary?

226
00:11:02,557 --> 00:11:05,551
You just can’t use a bicycle that costs only one or two thousand baht

227
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:07,324
because it’s not cool.

228
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:08,813
Unbelievable.

229
00:11:08,960 --> 00:11:10,000
If you’re here to scold me, leave.

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:10,709
Leave.

231
00:11:10,811 --> 00:11:12,868
Fine. I’m leaving.

232
00:11:13,911 --> 00:11:16,498
I was going to take you out on a nice meal.

233
00:11:16,905 --> 00:11:17,920
I guess we’re not going anymore.

234
00:11:18,861 --> 00:11:19,758
My big brother Shone.

235
00:11:19,758 --> 00:11:21,074
I’m sorry.

236
00:11:21,633 --> 00:11:25,402
I’m a teenager with mood swings.

237
00:11:25,402 --> 00:11:26,521
Please don’t hold it against this little kid.

238
00:11:28,377 --> 00:11:29,556
You troublemaker!

239
00:11:31,158 --> 00:11:31,991
Let me hug you.

240
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:35,900
Hey!

241
00:11:36,561 --> 00:11:37,523
Where did they go?

242
00:11:38,006 --> 00:11:39,460
They were just here!

243
00:11:39,714 --> 00:11:40,289
Really?

244
00:11:40,696 --> 00:11:41,499
Yes.

245
00:11:41,499 --> 00:11:42,739
Don’t you believe me?

246
00:11:43,171 --> 00:11:47,101
What does the guy who was fighting with Moo look like?

247
00:11:47,915 --> 00:11:50,635
He looks very good and classy.

248
00:11:51,220 --> 00:11:51,906
Really?

249
00:11:52,400 --> 00:11:56,896
From the look of it, there was something between them in Bangkok

250
00:11:57,049 --> 00:12:01,782
and now that Moo moved here, he came to win him back.

251
00:12:01,884 --> 00:12:03,718
I think you watch too many dramas.

252
00:12:03,718 --> 00:12:04,344
What?

253
00:12:05,590 --> 00:12:09,656
Don’t you want to know who that guy is?

254
00:12:09,697 --> 00:12:10,893
Do you want me to find out for you?

255
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:11,844
No.

256
00:12:11,844 --> 00:12:12,489
What?

257
00:12:13,802 --> 00:12:14,880
Kang!

258
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:16,022
Don’t you know what to know?

259
00:12:16,022 --> 00:12:17,174
I want to know!

260
00:12:22,768 --> 00:12:23,575
Go ahead.

261
00:12:23,906 --> 00:12:24,644
Enjoy it.

262
00:12:27,619 --> 00:12:28,583
By the way, Moo,

263
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,555
you said you only had 100-something baht left last week.

264
00:12:33,758 --> 00:12:35,169
How did you survive until now?

265
00:12:36,288 --> 00:12:37,477
I almost didn’t

266
00:12:37,477 --> 00:12:41,429
but destiny led me to my savior.

267
00:12:41,877 --> 00:12:43,258
Divine.

268
00:12:43,767 --> 00:12:44,386
How?

269
00:12:45,429 --> 00:12:48,415
It’s the guy who sells food at my school.

270
00:12:48,415 --> 00:12:51,422
He feels sorry for me that I don’t have money to buy food

271
00:12:51,422 --> 00:12:53,166
so he gives me free food

272
00:12:53,166 --> 00:12:54,577
but he’s so strict.

273
00:12:54,857 --> 00:12:56,122
The stricter he is, the cuter he gets though.

274
00:12:56,351 --> 00:12:57,343
So cute.

275
00:12:58,258 --> 00:13:00,453
You’ve only been here for a while but you’ve fallen in love already.

276
00:13:01,840 --> 00:13:03,042
And with someone older, no less.

277
00:13:04,364 --> 00:13:05,754
Do you have his photos?

278
00:13:06,059 --> 00:13:06,880
Photos?

279
00:13:09,386 --> 00:13:10,600
Photos, hmm?

280
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:11,891
I have some

281
00:13:11,891 --> 00:13:14,093
but I won’t show you.

282
00:13:14,755 --> 00:13:15,851
You’re getting on my nerves,

283
00:13:16,857 --> 00:13:20,815
so I’ll keep what I was going to say to myself.

284
00:13:21,280 --> 00:13:22,184
Come on, bro.

285
00:13:22,184 --> 00:13:24,002
Tell me then I’ll show you the photos.

286
00:13:24,129 --> 00:13:24,927
Please?

287
00:13:26,834 --> 00:13:28,197
Do you still dance?

288
00:13:29,392 --> 00:13:30,735
I do

289
00:13:31,473 --> 00:13:33,817
but I’m not going to audition anymore.

290
00:13:34,020 --> 00:13:37,560
I don’t want Mom to scold me so I’m going to study for the GAT/PAT exams first.

291
00:13:39,149 --> 00:13:39,968
Good.

292
00:13:39,968 --> 00:13:41,594
You should focus on your studies first

293
00:13:41,848 --> 00:13:45,052
because what I’m going to tell you might distract you.

294
00:13:46,400 --> 00:13:50,000
TTM is launching a project to find young talent to debut as T-pop idols.

295
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:50,993
Really?

296
00:13:50,993 --> 00:13:52,576
Why is it happening so early this year?

297
00:13:53,711 --> 00:13:55,964
If you’re not ready this year, you don’t have to go.

298
00:13:56,167 --> 00:13:57,642
It’s better to focus on your studies first.

299
00:13:58,253 --> 00:13:59,520
Now that I’ve told you that,

300
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:01,205
what does your boyfriend look like?

301
00:14:01,510 --> 00:14:02,341
Show me.

302
00:14:02,875 --> 00:14:04,142
He’s not my boyfriend yet.

303
00:14:04,142 --> 00:14:08,693
I’m flirting with him but he wouldn’t flirt back.

304
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:10,857
How do you hit on people?

305
00:14:11,640 --> 00:14:12,681
Me?

306
00:14:13,774 --> 00:14:14,899
I take care of them.

307
00:14:15,408 --> 00:14:19,086
If I come to a restaurant, I peel prawns for my crush.

308
00:14:20,230 --> 00:14:22,730
It’d definitely work.

309
00:14:24,256 --> 00:14:25,165
Trust me.

310
00:14:27,174 --> 00:14:27,960
Let me.

311
00:14:27,960 --> 00:14:29,414
That’s so heartwarming.

312
00:14:37,266 --> 00:14:38,146
Hi.

313
00:14:38,406 --> 00:14:38,906
Hi guys.

314
00:14:40,112 --> 00:14:41,472
You can try on your outfits.

315
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:44,114
These are XL for you.

316
00:14:44,114 --> 00:14:44,645
Okay.

317
00:14:44,645 --> 00:14:46,003
And these are L for you.

318
00:14:46,003 --> 00:14:46,689
Thank you.

319
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:48,078
The fitting room is inside.

320
00:14:48,078 --> 00:14:50,599
Try on the shirts first and let me know if they fit.

321
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:51,839
- Okay.
- I’ll be right back.

322
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:52,814
Thank you.

323
00:14:58,837 --> 00:14:59,809
You can go in first.

324
00:14:59,809 --> 00:15:01,263
Shout to let me know if they fit.

325
00:15:01,521 --> 00:15:02,160
No.

326
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:03,557
Let’s go in together.

327
00:15:03,557 --> 00:15:04,290
Don’t waste time.

328
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:04,996
Huh?

329
00:15:11,248 --> 00:15:12,009
The room is small.

330
00:15:12,454 --> 00:15:13,500
I told you.

331
00:15:13,700 --> 00:15:14,737
I’ll wait outside.

332
00:15:16,358 --> 00:15:17,264
Let’s change together.

333
00:15:17,264 --> 00:15:18,489
When you’re done, you can help me.

334
00:15:19,409 --> 00:15:20,575
Go ahead.

335
00:15:22,596 --> 00:15:23,178
Okay.

336
00:15:30,060 --> 00:15:30,704
Let me help.

337
00:15:30,824 --> 00:15:31,324
Hey.

338
00:15:32,224 --> 00:15:33,249
What are you playing?

339
00:15:33,329 --> 00:15:34,666
Nothing. I’m helping you.

340
00:15:34,986 --> 00:15:36,109
Hurry and put that on.

341
00:15:40,540 --> 00:15:41,420
I’m going to take off my shirt too.

342
00:15:58,203 --> 00:15:59,537
Why did you turn away from me?

343
00:15:59,537 --> 00:16:00,203
Huh?

344
00:16:03,486 --> 00:16:04,509
Just wear it like this.

345
00:16:09,551 --> 00:16:10,528
This shirt is good.

346
00:16:12,149 --> 00:16:14,898
If we get this shirt, I’m sure we’ll pass the audition.

347
00:16:23,881 --> 00:16:24,569
Let me see your shirt.

348
00:16:25,890 --> 00:16:26,668
Whoa,

349
00:16:27,528 --> 00:16:28,028
Yos.

350
00:16:29,289 --> 00:16:29,813
What?

351
00:16:29,813 --> 00:16:30,801
Why did you button your shirt like that?

352
00:16:31,241 --> 00:16:32,585
You did it wrong. Come on.

353
00:16:34,046 --> 00:16:34,946
Let me fix it.

354
00:16:36,207 --> 00:16:38,387
Wow. I have to redo everything.

355
00:16:43,092 --> 00:16:45,852
♪ You show you care, who could bear it? ♪

356
00:16:45,852 --> 00:16:47,802
♪ Don’t joke with my heart, can’t stand it ♪

357
00:16:47,802 --> 00:16:50,027
♪ You make me daydream, you know it? ♪

358
00:16:50,027 --> 00:16:52,636
♪ I keep my feelings inside ♪

359
00:16:52,636 --> 00:16:56,601
♪ Thinking of saying it but I hide ♪

360
00:16:56,716 --> 00:16:57,712
Stop it, Tae.

361
00:16:57,912 --> 00:16:58,924
I can button my own shirt.

362
00:16:59,204 --> 00:17:00,407
Hurry up and follow me when you’re done.

363
00:17:00,407 --> 00:17:01,110
Okay.

364
00:17:11,975 --> 00:17:14,801
Excuse me, are you Tae’s friend?

365
00:17:15,861 --> 00:17:16,523
Yes.

366
00:17:18,937 --> 00:17:19,693
Hi, Oei.

367
00:17:20,313 --> 00:17:21,057
Just in time.

368
00:17:21,393 --> 00:17:22,374
What do you think of my outfit?

369
00:17:23,555 --> 00:17:24,574
This is Earng Oei.

370
00:17:24,910 --> 00:17:26,258
I asked her to take a look at our outfits.

371
00:17:27,599 --> 00:17:29,763
This is Payos, my best buddy.

372
00:17:30,163 --> 00:17:31,092
Hi.

373
00:17:31,732 --> 00:17:33,249
Your outfit looks great.

374
00:17:33,409 --> 00:17:34,950
What are you going to wear it for?

375
00:17:34,950 --> 00:17:36,826
I think I’ll wear this for my audition.

376
00:17:37,066 --> 00:17:39,602
With this outfit, I’ll certainly pass.

377
00:17:39,923 --> 00:17:42,645
Just need some alterations. It should be ready tomorrow.

378
00:17:42,817 --> 00:17:45,285
So we can go to the movies today, right?

379
00:17:45,481 --> 00:17:46,125
Yes.

380
00:17:48,862 --> 00:17:50,004
I’m going to change back.

381
00:17:50,604 --> 00:17:51,328
See you.

382
00:18:00,792 --> 00:18:02,486
Thanks for the treat

383
00:18:02,766 --> 00:18:04,641
and this 1 kilo trick.

384
00:18:04,801 --> 00:18:05,414
Yeah.

385
00:18:05,803 --> 00:18:06,517
I’m going now.

386
00:18:06,517 --> 00:18:07,201
Thank you.

387
00:18:09,082 --> 00:18:10,041
Hold on.

388
00:18:22,215 --> 00:18:22,877
Here you go.

389
00:18:23,861 --> 00:18:24,719
Wow.

390
00:18:25,274 --> 00:18:26,020
20?

391
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,295
Just kidding.

392
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:28,909
Look at that face.

393
00:18:29,449 --> 00:18:30,523
Spend it wisely.

394
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:34,927
Thank you.

395
00:18:35,447 --> 00:18:37,641
He gave him money.

396
00:18:37,641 --> 00:18:38,664
Thank you, bro.

397
00:18:40,713 --> 00:18:42,241
Stop calling me bro.

398
00:18:43,715 --> 00:18:45,455
Call me Master.

399
00:18:46,070 --> 00:18:47,170
Of course, Master.

400
00:18:47,170 --> 00:18:48,552
Let me open the door for you.

401
00:18:51,173 --> 00:18:51,839
Here.

402
00:18:53,241 --> 00:18:54,185
See you.

403
00:18:54,185 --> 00:18:54,949
Okay.

404
00:18:56,050 --> 00:18:57,335
Safe trip.

405
00:18:57,335 --> 00:18:57,960
Thanks.

406
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:03,679
Moo was buttering him up like this and he gave him money.

407
00:19:04,419 --> 00:19:06,481
Looks like his sugar daddy wants him back.

408
00:19:06,865 --> 00:19:08,365
Forgive me for sticking my nose in

409
00:19:08,876 --> 00:19:10,121
but you’re my friend.

410
00:19:10,421 --> 00:19:12,433
I don’t want you to feel hurt by finding out later.

411
00:19:14,954 --> 00:19:16,148
Why would I feel hurt?

412
00:19:16,308 --> 00:19:17,782
He and I are nothing to each other.

413
00:19:17,962 --> 00:19:19,055
I know you’re just being stubborn.

414
00:19:19,935 --> 00:19:20,807
Hey, Kang.

415
00:19:21,687 --> 00:19:22,427
There you are.

416
00:19:24,128 --> 00:19:25,040
Ask him where he went and who was with him.

417
00:19:25,040 --> 00:19:26,473
Is that guy his friend with benefits?

418
00:19:27,413 --> 00:19:27,950
Neth,

419
00:19:28,590 --> 00:19:30,080
your face is twitching.

420
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:30,939
Are you okay?

421
00:19:32,106 --> 00:19:35,066
I’m fine. Nothing is wrong with me.

422
00:19:35,899 --> 00:19:37,899
Kang wants to ask you something.

423
00:19:37,899 --> 00:19:39,521
Ask him what you want to know, Kang.

424
00:19:39,521 --> 00:19:40,147
Ask him.

425
00:19:41,506 --> 00:19:43,686
I wanted to ask if you’re fully recovered.

426
00:19:43,842 --> 00:19:45,522
I saw you walking around.

427
00:19:46,053 --> 00:19:47,214
You must be fully recovered.

428
00:19:48,094 --> 00:19:50,548
Kang, do you know you sound a bit angry?

429
00:19:50,548 --> 00:19:51,571
It’s my normal voice.

430
00:19:51,931 --> 00:19:53,332
Who was that guy who came to see you?

431
00:19:53,332 --> 00:19:54,400
Where did you guys go?

432
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:55,763
Kang wants to know.

433
00:19:55,763 --> 00:19:56,311
Neth!

434
00:19:57,031 --> 00:19:58,157
I don’t want to know.

435
00:19:58,857 --> 00:20:01,594
Even though you don’t want to know, I want to tell you.

436
00:20:01,734 --> 00:20:02,381
Wait up!

437
00:20:02,607 --> 00:20:04,607
Yes! This boy is a fighter!

438
00:20:04,607 --> 00:20:05,401
Go, Moo!

439
00:20:05,617 --> 00:20:07,277
I’m rooting for you!

440
00:20:08,886 --> 00:20:09,895
I got you some prawns.

441
00:20:11,121 --> 00:20:12,186
Let me peel them for you.

442
00:20:15,742 --> 00:20:19,545
Don’t be sad, single people, that you don’t have anyone to peel prawns for you.

443
00:20:22,186 --> 00:20:23,453
Who are you talking to?

444
00:20:25,334 --> 00:20:29,413
Nature.

445
00:20:29,802 --> 00:20:31,342
I’ve been crazy lately.

446
00:20:31,805 --> 00:20:32,657
Crazy in love with you.

447
00:20:34,298 --> 00:20:38,337
Aren’t you curious about what Neth asked? About who I was with?

448
00:20:38,641 --> 00:20:40,732
Where and who you’re going with is your business.

449
00:20:40,732 --> 00:20:43,566
But I want you to know who I was with.

450
00:20:43,966 --> 00:20:45,064
I. was with my cousin.

451
00:20:45,964 --> 00:20:47,175
I’m very close with him.

452
00:20:47,175 --> 00:20:50,738
Mom noticed that I’ve been quiet so she sent him to check on me.

453
00:20:50,998 --> 00:20:52,655
When he came, he took me out for a meal.

454
00:20:53,395 --> 00:20:54,023
That’s it.

455
00:20:54,623 --> 00:20:55,129
Really?

456
00:20:57,610 --> 00:21:00,401
When I was eating, the food was good, you know?

457
00:21:00,401 --> 00:21:03,089
So I thought about you. I wanted you to have yummy food too.

458
00:21:06,391 --> 00:21:07,024
What?

459
00:21:07,544 --> 00:21:08,268
It’s this small?

460
00:21:08,588 --> 00:21:10,005
Stop. You’re wasting it.

461
00:21:10,005 --> 00:21:10,850
Let me do the peeling.

462
00:21:18,121 --> 00:21:18,894
Here you go.

463
00:21:20,755 --> 00:21:21,606
Whoa.

464
00:21:22,226 --> 00:21:23,271
You peeled it all by yourself.

465
00:21:23,911 --> 00:21:25,081
I didn’t get to do it for you at all.

466
00:21:25,941 --> 00:21:27,488
If I let you,

467
00:21:27,908 --> 00:21:29,529
I’d only get to eat the shell.

468
00:21:30,169 --> 00:21:30,999
Hold on.

469
00:21:33,500 --> 00:21:34,971
Let me take care of you for a change.

470
00:21:35,571 --> 00:21:36,441
I can do it myself.

471
00:21:36,441 --> 00:21:37,607
Please, Kang?

472
00:21:38,888 --> 00:21:39,801
I’ll take that as a yes.

473
00:21:40,881 --> 00:21:41,572
Come on.

474
00:21:45,434 --> 00:21:46,515
Let me wipe your hands.

475
00:21:50,117 --> 00:21:53,110
About what you asked me to think about yesterday,

476
00:21:53,310 --> 00:21:54,461
I already thought it over

477
00:21:55,101 --> 00:21:56,566
both while asleep and awake.

478
00:21:57,987 --> 00:21:59,359
I still feel the same.

479
00:22:01,104 --> 00:22:06,757
That means I really like you.

480
00:22:11,199 --> 00:22:13,995
I’ve been acting goofy because

481
00:22:18,077 --> 00:22:19,423
I really want to win your heart.

482
00:22:39,049 --> 00:22:39,921
Your hands smell good now.

483
00:22:40,761 --> 00:22:41,627
They no longer smell of prawns.

484
00:22:45,809 --> 00:22:47,473
You don’t have to do that much.

485
00:22:49,376 --> 00:22:50,130
Are you shy with me?

486
00:22:50,730 --> 00:22:51,596
Are you shy with me?

487
00:22:52,011 --> 00:22:53,115
I’m not shy.

488
00:22:53,275 --> 00:22:54,998
You can’t be trusted with cleanliness.

489
00:22:56,419 --> 00:22:57,796
I better wash my hands.

490
00:23:16,844 --> 00:23:17,786
Did that work?

491
00:23:18,866 --> 00:23:19,997
I don’t think so.

492
00:23:22,018 --> 00:23:23,090
Ugh! It’s the head!

493
00:23:36,378 --> 00:23:37,060
What’s up?

494
00:23:37,408 --> 00:23:37,931
Bro,

495
00:23:38,726 --> 00:23:42,044
how many months and days do you think it’ll take for someone to agree to date you?

496
00:23:44,339 --> 00:23:45,580
What are you talking about?

497
00:23:45,696 --> 00:23:46,484
Who told you to be crazy in love?

498
00:23:47,063 --> 00:23:50,277
Didn’t any tricks I gave you work at all?

499
00:23:50,663 --> 00:23:53,602
I don’t know. He gave me no reaction.

500
00:23:53,756 --> 00:23:55,186
I’m going to explode.

501
00:23:55,186 --> 00:23:56,257
Help me, bro.

502
00:24:00,284 --> 00:24:01,339
Bro, are you there?

503
00:24:03,444 --> 00:24:04,454
Listen.

504
00:24:05,284 --> 00:24:07,168
It’s only been a day.

505
00:24:07,631 --> 00:24:10,112
This kind of thing requires consistency.

506
00:24:10,653 --> 00:24:12,962
Keep doing it and showing him every day.

507
00:24:13,406 --> 00:24:17,751
If it were me, I love taking photos, so I’d give him beautiful photos.

508
00:24:18,002 --> 00:24:19,621
Send him videos.

509
00:24:19,925 --> 00:24:25,104
Whatever you’re good at, use that to impress him.

510
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:25,957
Trust me.

511
00:24:26,556 --> 00:24:27,787
Ah.

512
00:24:27,787 --> 00:24:28,520
Okay, bro.

513
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:29,160
I have an idea now.

514
00:24:29,160 --> 00:24:30,006
Thank you so much.

515
00:24:30,199 --> 00:24:31,270
Bye. I won’t keep you any longer.

516
00:24:33,394 --> 00:24:33,903
Oh?

517
00:24:41,993 --> 00:24:42,764
Peekaboo.

518
00:24:42,764 --> 00:24:43,350
Shit.

519
00:24:47,695 --> 00:24:50,120
I love you. My love is true.

520
00:24:50,395 --> 00:24:52,665
Don’t be mad, boo.

521
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,681
I love you for real. It’s what my heart tells me.

522
00:24:55,681 --> 00:24:57,707
My dear Kang,

523
00:24:57,707 --> 00:24:58,778
please have mercy.

524
00:24:59,419 --> 00:25:00,176
Damn.

525
00:25:00,620 --> 00:25:02,026
Are you a poet now?

526
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:04,140
Go away. I need to sell food.

527
00:25:04,565 --> 00:25:05,132
Come on.

528
00:25:05,904 --> 00:25:07,324
Why the sarcasm, my boo?

529
00:25:09,892 --> 00:25:11,169
What did you just call me?

530
00:25:12,096 --> 00:25:12,695
My boo.

531
00:25:13,004 --> 00:25:14,062
Don’t call me boo.

532
00:25:14,313 --> 00:25:19,903
My boo.

533
00:25:19,903 --> 00:25:20,709
Stop it!

534
00:25:21,161 --> 00:25:22,353
Don’t call me that.

535
00:25:22,894 --> 00:25:23,782
I just called you my boo.

536
00:25:23,782 --> 00:25:24,525
Why do you have to be so angry?

537
00:25:24,525 --> 00:25:25,364
I don’t get it.

538
00:25:25,480 --> 00:25:27,006
Everyone can hear you.

539
00:25:27,006 --> 00:25:28,564
Don’t give them the wrong idea.

540
00:25:28,661 --> 00:25:31,183
Shut up or I’ll pinch your mouth!

541
00:25:32,399 --> 00:25:32,899
Okay.

542
00:25:33,844 --> 00:25:34,884
My boo.

543
00:25:34,884 --> 00:25:35,546
Shit.

544
00:25:38,616 --> 00:25:40,007

No, you go first. I’ll watch your back.

555
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:33,056
That’s Tae and Payos.

556
00:26:33,539 --> 00:26:34,680
Where are they going?

557
00:26:36,456 --> 00:26:37,548
Hey, the three of you!

558
00:26:37,702 --> 00:26:38,569
What are you doing?

559
00:26:38,569 --> 00:26:39,688
Shit. The director is here.

560
00:26:39,688 --> 00:26:41,182
Are you watching porn?

561
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:44,014
What are they doing?

562
00:26:44,362 --> 00:26:45,640
- Go.
- You go.

563
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:46,347
I’ll watch your back.

564
00:26:48,529 --> 00:26:50,729
You’re Tank. Why aren’t you in the front?

565
00:26:51,085 --> 00:26:55,004
- You go.
- You go first.

566
00:26:55,004 --> 00:26:55,653
What are you guys doing?

567
00:26:55,888 --> 00:26:56,484
Skipping school?

568
00:26:56,754 --> 00:26:57,574
Mind your own business

569
00:26:57,651 --> 00:26:59,525
I would but the director is nearby.

570
00:27:00,008 --> 00:27:00,764
Come on, Tae.

571
00:27:00,764 --> 00:27:01,528
We don’t want to be late for the audition.

572
00:27:01,528 --> 00:27:02,386
We need to get the outfits too.

573
00:27:02,386 --> 00:27:02,924
Fine.

574
00:27:02,924 --> 00:27:03,575
Are you going to audition?

575
00:27:04,695 --> 00:27:05,195
Yes.

576
00:27:05,774 --> 00:27:07,235
Someone already saw our talent.

577
00:27:07,621 --> 00:27:08,515
We don’t need you.

578
00:27:08,889 --> 00:27:09,389
Go.

579
00:27:14,390 --> 00:27:14,998
Shit!

580
00:27:15,124 --> 00:27:16,004
It’s Somkhuan!

581
00:27:16,158 --> 00:27:17,450
You guys go.

582
00:27:17,450 --> 00:27:18,259
And pass that audition.

583
00:27:18,259 --> 00:27:19,382
Hurry, Tae!

584
00:27:19,575 --> 00:27:20,391
What are you guys doing?

585
00:27:20,661 --> 00:27:21,387
Stop!

586
00:27:21,696 --> 00:27:22,495
Hurry and follow me, Tae!

587
00:27:22,495 --> 00:27:23,168
Okay!

588
00:27:23,670 --> 00:27:24,404
I’m coming!

589
00:27:28,446 --> 00:27:29,085
Hi, Director.

590
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:29,766
Hi.

591
00:27:29,766 --> 00:27:31,325
Stay here, Mok.

592
00:27:31,325 --> 00:27:32,619
Were you going to skip school?

593
00:27:32,619 --> 00:27:33,650
People skipped school?

594
00:27:33,650 --> 00:27:34,150
Yes.

595
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,222
Let me help you find them.

596
00:27:35,222 --> 00:27:37,044
You’re so kind to the school.

597
00:27:37,044 --> 00:27:39,117
Who were those two?

598
00:27:39,117 --> 00:27:40,121
I didn’t see anyone.

599
00:27:40,121 --> 00:27:41,464
Let’s talk in my office.

600
00:27:43,530 --> 00:27:49,201
This punishment is probably the only way you can learn to improve yourself.

601
00:27:50,294 --> 00:27:51,734
Solve the math problems.

602
00:27:52,486 --> 00:27:53,926
You must get all answers correct.

603
00:27:53,967 --> 00:27:57,048
If you don’t finish them or get them right, you can’t go anywhere.

604
00:27:57,089 --> 00:27:58,524
Stay with me all day.

605
00:27:58,682 --> 00:27:59,736
I’m free today.

606
00:28:06,363 --> 00:28:08,653
One kind of poison comes in the form of math practice questions

607
00:28:09,296 --> 00:28:10,234
for the PAT1 Exam.

608
00:28:19,216 --> 00:28:19,811
Director.

609
00:28:19,811 --> 00:28:20,311
Hmm?

610
00:28:20,311 --> 00:28:22,004
I haven’t had lunch.

611
00:28:22,157 --> 00:28:24,157
I’m feeling low on energy.

612
00:28:24,157 --> 00:28:26,364
I have a headache. My brain is not functioning.

613
00:28:26,836 --> 00:28:28,179
May I go get something to eat first?

614
00:28:28,546 --> 00:28:29,374
Goodbye.

615
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:33,063
You may not.

616
00:28:33,372 --> 00:28:34,692
Oh.

617
00:28:35,310 --> 00:28:39,625
But if you don’t allow me to eat and I get an ulcer,

618
00:28:39,625 --> 00:28:43,625
you’ll be guilty of unreasonable hurting and punishment.

619
00:28:48,626 --> 00:28:50,351
Aren’t you a smart boy?

620
00:28:51,298 --> 00:28:52,361
Don’t worry.

621
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:54,395
I’ll take care of you.

622
00:28:54,568 --> 00:28:55,231
Okay.

623
00:28:56,621 --> 00:28:58,069
How are we doing?

624
00:28:58,320 --> 00:29:01,442
It’s been 20 minutes and you still haven’t done anything besides spinning your pencil.

625
00:29:03,103 --> 00:29:04,006
Uh…

626
00:29:04,180 --> 00:29:05,189
Okay, I’ll use the pencil.

627
00:29:07,358 --> 00:29:08,266
Please come in.

628
00:29:09,618 --> 00:29:10,683
Your food has arrived.

629
00:29:10,683 --> 00:29:11,457
Thank you.

630
00:29:13,425 --> 00:29:14,062
Hey, Kang.

631
00:29:14,410 --> 00:29:15,032
Oh, hey.

632
00:29:15,341 --> 00:29:16,389
Why are you here?

633
00:29:16,833 --> 00:29:17,569
What did you do?

634
00:29:19,191 --> 00:29:20,360
What could it be?

635
00:29:20,746 --> 00:29:22,507
He helped his friends skip school

636
00:29:22,951 --> 00:29:27,448
and when he got caught, he refused to give me any useful information.

637
00:29:27,641 --> 00:29:29,745
That’s why he’s getting punished here.

638
00:29:29,996 --> 00:29:31,645
Bring the other plate here.

639
00:29:31,645 --> 00:29:32,365
Sure.

640
00:29:32,751 --> 00:29:34,500
I ordered food for you.

641
00:29:35,041 --> 00:29:36,716
Now you can eat and do this at the same time.

642
00:29:37,004 --> 00:29:39,376
If you don’t finish it, we’ll stay here for a long time.

643
00:29:42,724 --> 00:29:43,715
(Help me!)

644
00:29:43,715 --> 00:29:45,019
(Help me, Kang!)

645
00:29:47,085 --> 00:29:48,835
Please excuse me then, Director.

646
00:29:48,835 --> 00:29:49,423
Okay.

647
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:50,382
Put it on my tab as usual.

648
00:29:50,382 --> 00:29:50,931
Of course.

649
00:29:50,931 --> 00:29:52,004
As usual, right?

650
00:29:52,004 --> 00:29:52,504
Yeah.

651
00:30:01,319 --> 00:30:02,477
(Come help me!)

652
00:30:02,477 --> 00:30:03,223
(Kang!)

653
00:30:11,455 --> 00:30:12,091
Keep working.

654
00:30:12,404 --> 00:30:13,195
Yes, Director.

655
00:30:13,427 --> 00:30:14,784
Your food has arrived. Eat it.

656
00:30:14,784 --> 00:30:15,318
Okay.

657
00:30:15,318 --> 00:30:16,138
Or do I have to feed you?

658
00:30:17,007 --> 00:30:17,994
I can feed myself.

659
00:30:19,443 --> 00:30:20,562
I can eat here, right?

660
00:30:20,562 --> 00:30:21,158
Yeah.

661
00:30:21,158 --> 00:30:22,480
I’m going to finish this and eat at the same time.

662
00:30:23,369 --> 00:30:24,370
I’m so happy.

663
00:30:24,370 --> 00:30:25,567
The happiest in the world.

664
00:30:25,567 --> 00:30:26,193
Exactly.

665
00:30:29,089 --> 00:30:29,913
Yeah.

667
00:30:32,685 --> 00:30:33,346
Kang.

668
00:30:34,485 --> 00:30:35,115
I’m here.

669
00:30:36,274 --> 00:30:37,334
Did you finish the math practice questions?

670
00:30:38,338 --> 00:30:39,690
The director wouldn’t have let me leave otherwise.

671
00:30:40,004 --> 00:30:41,420
He’s so cruel.

672
00:30:41,690 --> 00:30:42,534
I almost died.

673
00:30:42,862 --> 00:30:45,564
If it wasn’t for your Kai Palo, I would be dead.

674
00:30:45,743 --> 00:30:46,760
It’s so yummy.

675
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:47,687
I could eat it every day.

676
00:30:48,286 --> 00:30:49,925
You can try other places.

677
00:30:50,137 --> 00:30:50,766
I won’t be mad.

678
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:51,805
I don’t want to.

679
00:30:52,944 --> 00:30:53,697
By the way,

680
00:30:54,141 --> 00:30:55,328
I want you to listen to something.

681
00:30:55,637 --> 00:30:56,681
I finished writing it just now.

You’re stunned, aren’t you?

690
00:31:43,586 --> 00:31:44,196
That’s the bell.

691
00:31:44,196 --> 00:31:45,084
Go to class.

692
00:31:45,084 --> 00:31:46,500
No, I’m vibing right now.

693
00:31:46,500 --> 00:31:47,221
Mok!

694
00:31:48,082 --> 00:31:49,219
What are you still doing here?

695
00:31:50,413 --> 00:31:51,276
Eating.

696
00:31:51,276 --> 00:31:52,969
I was hungry after…

697
00:31:52,969 --> 00:31:53,797
Time’s up.

698
00:31:53,797 --> 00:31:54,582
Go to class.

699
00:31:54,622 --> 00:31:57,472
If I catch you skipping classes, I’ll make you recite the periodic table until school is over.

700
00:31:57,472 --> 00:31:58,201
Yes, sir.

701
00:31:58,201 --> 00:31:59,367
You won’t get to go home this evening.

702
00:31:59,367 --> 00:32:00,724
Hey, where are you going?

703
00:32:01,022 --> 00:32:01,920
Go now

704
00:32:01,920 --> 00:32:03,474
or you’ll get punished again.

705
00:32:04,552 --> 00:32:05,382
Hey!

706
00:32:05,382 --> 00:32:06,670
Why are you so fast?

707
00:32:07,416 --> 00:32:09,097
You don’t know what this former Nakhon Pathom representative is capable of!

708
00:32:09,244 --> 00:32:10,814
We shouldn’t have let Moo help us.

709
00:32:11,644 --> 00:32:12,604
I’m sure he wants us to owe him.

710
00:32:13,322 --> 00:32:14,498
You’re too prejudiced.

711
00:32:14,609 --> 00:32:16,004
I think he wants to help us.

712
00:32:17,966 --> 00:32:18,884
Excuse me.

713
00:32:19,326 --> 00:32:21,231
Oh, you’re here to pick up your outfits.

714
00:32:22,945 --> 00:32:25,501
This is L for you.

715
00:32:25,501 --> 00:32:26,224
Thank you.

716
00:32:26,887 --> 00:32:28,277
What about mine?

717
00:32:28,277 --> 00:32:31,221
Your girlfriend has already picked up the XL size for you.

718
00:32:32,078 --> 00:32:32,884
My girlfriend?

719
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:34,648
There, in front of the shop.

720
00:32:45,013 --> 00:32:46,538
Hey, please don’t.

721
00:32:47,257 --> 00:32:48,508
I beg you.

722
00:32:51,106 --> 00:32:52,022

723
00:32:53,487 --> 00:32:54,609

00:33:55,542 --> 00:33:56,372
Hi, Mom.

732
00:33:56,372 --> 00:33:57,183
Do you need anything?

733
00:33:57,183 --> 00:33:58,344
I’m in the middle of something.

734
00:34:00,045 --> 00:34:01,028
What?

735
00:34:01,028 --> 00:34:02,902
I’m heading there right now.

736
00:34:15,807 --> 00:34:16,647
Tae,

737
00:34:17,644 --> 00:34:19,099
you should wear my outfit to the audition.

738
00:34:19,486 --> 00:34:20,324
No.

739
00:34:20,821 --> 00:34:21,848
It’s not your fault.

740
00:34:23,524 --> 00:34:26,981
It’s my fault for being a jerk to them.

741
00:34:28,418 --> 00:34:29,281
I have to accept it.

742
00:34:30,359 --> 00:34:31,283
I’m not going.

743
00:34:32,029 --> 00:34:35,117
What? But you’ve dreamt about this all your life.

744
00:34:35,449 --> 00:34:36,923
I don’t want to become an idol as much as you.

745
00:34:38,111 --> 00:34:40,168
I’m happy with dancing just for fun.

746
00:34:41,644 --> 00:34:45,969
Even if I pass the audition, I don’t know if I’m ready to dedicate my whole life to dancing.

747
00:34:48,636 --> 00:34:49,621
What are you talking about?

748
00:34:52,274 --> 00:34:53,551
I’ve always thought

749
00:34:56,177 --> 00:34:57,382
this was your dream too.

750
00:35:01,859 --> 00:35:03,102
This is not the time to talk about it.

751
00:35:03,406 --> 00:35:04,380
Just go.

752
00:35:05,043 --> 00:35:06,008
Don’t miss your opportunity.

753
00:35:08,606 --> 00:35:09,433
Take it.

754
00:35:29,138 --> 00:35:30,124
Mom.

755
00:35:30,124 --> 00:35:30,867
Kang.

756
00:35:30,867 --> 00:35:31,973
How are you feeling?

757
00:35:31,973 --> 00:35:32,857
Does it hurt a lot?

758
00:35:32,857 --> 00:35:34,510
How did you fall?

759
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:35,791
What did the doctor say?

760
00:35:35,791 --> 00:35:36,647
How did you get here?

761
00:35:36,647 --> 00:35:37,625
Come on.

762
00:35:37,625 --> 00:35:39,655
Leave some time for me to answer.

763
00:35:39,655 --> 00:35:42,187
I’m really fine now. Don’t worry.

764
00:35:42,187 --> 00:35:44,280
You carried something heavy again, didn’t you?

765
00:35:44,556 --> 00:35:46,521
How many times have I told you not to force yourself?

766
00:35:49,644 --> 00:35:51,323
Who brought you to the hospital?

767
00:36:08,154 --> 00:36:09,237
Come.

768
00:36:09,237 --> 00:36:10,379
Check out my hot food.

769
00:36:10,379 --> 00:36:12,190
It’s the two of you for today?

770
00:36:12,190 --> 00:36:14,316
The food is almost out. How many boxes would you like?

771
00:36:14,316 --> 00:36:14,899
Two?

772
00:36:14,899 --> 00:36:15,484
That’s enough.

773
00:36:15,484 --> 00:36:16,118
This is enough?

774
00:36:16,118 --> 00:36:16,866
Alright.

775
00:36:17,446 --> 00:36:19,144
Young man, come.

776
00:36:19,448 --> 00:36:20,324
What would you like?

777
00:36:20,324 --> 00:36:21,730
A meal box or something else?

778
00:36:21,730 --> 00:36:22,614
No, thank you.

779
00:36:23,194 --> 00:36:24,852
What event is this?

780
00:36:25,073 --> 00:36:27,314
Oh, it’s a merit-making event and food giveaway.

781
00:36:27,314 --> 00:36:29,130
Take this.

782
00:36:29,130 --> 00:36:30,637
- Maybe you can share it with your mom.
- No, it’s okay.

783
00:36:30,637 --> 00:36:32,337
I’m just here to take photos for my job.

784
00:36:32,404 --> 00:36:34,063
This is delicious.

785
00:36:34,063 --> 00:36:35,379
You have to try it.

786
00:36:35,379 --> 00:36:36,850
Take it. Do you want some more?

787
00:36:36,850 --> 00:36:38,604
No, this is enough. Thank you so much.

788
00:36:38,604 --> 00:36:39,548
You’re welcome.

789
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:41,534
Ouch!

790
00:36:42,446 --> 00:36:43,436
Auntie!

791
00:36:43,733 --> 00:36:44,467
Are you alright?

792
00:36:45,733 --> 00:36:46,999
Slowly.

793
00:36:47,285 --> 00:36:50,225
- Ouch!
- Slowly.

794
00:36:50,799 --> 00:36:52,080
What’s wrong with me?

795
00:36:56,789 --> 00:36:59,044
There he is.

796
00:37:06,514 --> 00:37:07,618
Hi.

797
00:37:07,950 --> 00:37:11,556
These are your painkiller and muscle relaxant, Auntie.

798
00:37:11,556 --> 00:37:12,824
I’ve put the receipt in here.

799
00:37:13,349 --> 00:37:14,170
Okay.

800
00:37:14,391 --> 00:37:15,251
Thank you.

801
00:37:16,025 --> 00:37:17,849
Thank you for helping my mom.

802
00:37:17,849 --> 00:37:19,369
No worries. It’s my pleasure.

803
00:37:20,640 --> 00:37:21,966
Please excuse me.

804
00:37:22,242 --> 00:37:22,935
Alright.

805
00:37:23,101 --> 00:37:24,326
- Thank you so much.
- You’re welcome.

806
00:37:27,374 --> 00:37:28,764
He’s so kind.

807
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:32,256
Mom, wait here.I’ll be right back.

808
00:37:32,256 --> 00:37:33,003
Where are you going?

809
00:37:33,169 --> 00:37:34,430
Just a moment. I’ll be right back.

810
00:37:34,430 --> 00:37:35,068
Okay.

811
00:37:35,068 --> 00:37:35,804
Hurry back.

812
00:37:40,613 --> 00:37:41,644
Excuse me.

813
00:37:42,825 --> 00:37:43,600
Yes?

814
00:37:44,816 --> 00:37:47,776
I really want to return the favor for helping my mom.

815
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:51,643
Just saying thank you probably won’t be enough.

816
00:37:53,357 --> 00:37:54,863
Don’t worry about it. It’s my pleasure.

817
00:37:56,245 --> 00:37:57,244
Please take this.

818
00:37:58,324 --> 00:37:59,670
Oh, it’s the wrong side.

819
00:38:01,605 --> 00:38:02,532
Thank you.

820
00:38:03,004 --> 00:38:05,311
One free meal at Mommy Kai Rice & Curry

821
00:38:06,334 --> 00:38:07,398
near Maneneth Dormitory.

822
00:38:07,804 --> 00:38:09,153
You must come.

823
00:38:09,153 --> 00:38:11,385
Mom and I really want to return the favor.

824
00:38:11,882 --> 00:38:12,681
Okay.

825
00:38:13,096 --> 00:38:14,853
I’ll be there.

826
00:38:16,108 --> 00:38:17,282
My name is Kang.

827
00:38:18,470 --> 00:38:19,296
I’m Shone.

828
00:38:19,683 --> 00:38:21,379
We know each other now.

829
00:38:21,379 --> 00:38:23,121
Please keep your word, Mr. Shone.

830
00:38:23,121 --> 00:38:25,406
You said you’ll come to eat at our place.

831
00:38:26,059 --> 00:38:26,807
Of course,

832
00:38:27,332 --> 00:38:29,312
but can I ask for one thing?

833
00:38:29,948 --> 00:38:31,200
You don’t have to call me Mr.

834
00:38:31,338 --> 00:38:32,410
Just call me Shone.

835
00:38:32,924 --> 00:38:34,155
Alright, Shone.

836
00:38:34,376 --> 00:38:36,831
I’ll see you then.

837
00:38:37,716 --> 00:38:38,966
Okay. See you.

838
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:40,264
Thank you so much.

839
00:38:40,684 --> 00:38:41,514
You’re welcome.

840
00:38:41,644 --> 00:38:42,948
I should go.

841
00:38:42,948 --> 00:38:43,575
Okay.

842
00:38:44,128 --> 00:38:44,727
Thank you.

843
00:38:44,727 --> 00:38:45,525
Thanks.

844
00:39:04,194 --> 00:39:04,801
Hey.

845
00:39:06,846 --> 00:39:08,125
Aren’t you supposed to be outside school?

846
00:39:08,457 --> 00:39:10,312
I’m back to get the assignments for Tae.

847
00:39:10,865 --> 00:39:12,300
He went to the audition.

848
00:39:12,564 --> 00:39:13,271
Huh?

849
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:14,940
Why didn’t you both go?

850
00:39:16,004 --> 00:39:17,613
There’s a little problem

851
00:39:17,782 --> 00:39:20,099
and I didn’t want to hold him back, so I made him go alone.

852
00:39:20,444 --> 00:39:21,656
What?

853
00:39:22,043 --> 00:39:25,771
I helped both of you skip school and even got punished by the director.

854
00:39:25,937 --> 00:39:26,847
Yeah.

855
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:30,665
I’m confused why you helped us escape from him.

856
00:39:30,997 --> 00:39:32,293
If you guys skipped school for something else,

857
00:39:32,293 --> 00:39:33,495
I wouldn’t want to help.

858
00:39:33,688 --> 00:39:36,790
But you guys were going to audition and follow your dream.

859
00:39:36,790 --> 00:39:38,299
That’s why I want to help.

860
00:39:38,524 --> 00:39:39,864
I know how you guys feel.

861
00:39:39,964 --> 00:39:41,358
Thank you so much.

862

The next time you want to film a dance clip, you can ask us to join.

863
00:39:45,524 --> 00:39:46,669
Or I can take it for you.

864
00:39:47,244 --> 00:39:49,170
I saw your clip. It’s so cool.

865
00:39:49,444 --> 00:39:50,200

but I didn’t see you.

883
00:40:48,672 --> 00:40:51,270
I saw the Kai Palo tray on the floor so I asked the stall next door what happened.

884
00:40:51,463 --> 00:40:56,379
They said you were so shocked to hear your mom was in the hospital that you just left it and hurried off.

I don’t have feelings for you.

6
00:00:19,115 --> 00:00:20,848
Then I’ll flirt with you until you fall for me.

7
00:00:21,975 --> 00:00:27,009
I’ve been acting goofy because I really want to win your heart.

8
00:00:27,622 --> 00:00:28,434
Come on, Tae.

9
00:00:28,434 --> 00:00:29,320
We don’t want to be late for the audition.

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:30,288
You guys go.

11
00:00:30,288 --> 00:00:31,068
And pass that audition.

12
00:00:31,068 --> 00:00:32,006
Hurry, Tae!

13
00:00:33,240 --> 00:00:34,397
Let’s talk in my office.

14
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:38,120
How many months and days do you think it’ll take for someone to agree to date you?

15
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:41,771
Whatever you’re good at, use that to impress him.

won’t turn away anymore.

Are you happy now?

50
00:04:15,308 --> 00:04:16,353
You’re no fun.

51
00:04:17,333 --> 00:04:20,618
Of course, I’m not your Moo.

52
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:22,204
It’s a good song though.

53
00:04:22,204 --> 00:04:24,560
I can sing it after listening for just a bit.

54
00:04:24,773 --> 00:04:26,773
Your Moo is such a genius.

55
00:04:26,773 --> 00:04:29,775
Did I make the right decision to come to you for advice?

56
00:04:29,775 --> 00:04:30,758
Of course, you did.

57
00:04:30,758 --> 00:04:32,253
Tell me what you need advice on.

58
00:04:37,268 --> 00:04:40,935
What do you think of him writing a song for me?

59
00:04:40,935 --> 00:04:42,994
Oh, please.

60
00:04:43,035 --> 00:04:46,234
Moo is crazy about you very very much.

61
00:04:46,234 --> 00:04:47,440
He’d register his marriage with you tomorrow.

62
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:47,945
You’re exaggerating.

63
00:04:48,719 --> 00:04:49,463
I’m not exaggerating.

64
00:04:49,463 --> 00:04:51,880
I could see it from the crocodile farm in another district.

65
00:04:51,880 --> 00:04:54,964
It’s up to you what you feel after listening to the song.

66
00:04:56,432 --> 00:04:57,477
But you feel something.

67
00:04:57,722 --> 00:05:00,825
Otherwise, you wouldn’t have come to me for advice.

68
00:05:01,291 --> 00:05:01,847
Am I right?

69
00:05:02,435 --> 00:05:03,286
Yeah.

70
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:06,791
But I don’t want to feel anything more.

71
00:05:07,101 --> 00:05:08,076
What’s holding you back?

72
00:05:08,738 --> 00:05:10,718
You know I’ve never dated anyone.

73
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:12,191
And?

74
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:13,970
And he’s only here for one semester.

75
00:05:14,387 --> 00:05:16,096
He’s going to university next semester.

76
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:16,835
And?

77
00:05:16,835 --> 00:05:18,322
We’ll be far apart.

78
00:05:18,322 --> 00:05:21,957
Haven’t you ever seen someone living in America dating someone in Thailand?

79
00:05:21,957 --> 00:05:25,026
They live in completely different time zones but they make it work.

80
00:05:25,026 --> 00:05:26,550
You’re both in Thailand.

81
00:05:26,550 --> 00:05:28,900
Bangkok and Nakhon Pathom are only 2 hours apart.

82
00:05:28,900 --> 00:05:30,270
I think he’s still a kid.

83
00:05:30,438 --> 00:05:31,128
And?

84
00:05:31,128 --> 00:05:32,928
Can’t a kid be in love?

85
00:05:32,928 --> 00:05:34,033
You’re not even that old.

86
00:05:34,033 --> 00:05:35,682
You guys are only 2 years apart.

87
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:37,035
What else is holding you back? Tell me.

88
00:05:39,805 --> 00:05:41,728
Is something going on between you and Moo?

89
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:46,047
You know you can tell me anything, right?

90
00:05:52,311 --> 00:05:53,167
It’s none of your business.

91
00:05:54,687 --> 00:05:55,831
Excuse you?

92
00:06:01,274 --> 00:06:01,992
Kang.

93
00:06:03,046 --> 00:06:04,160
Give it back.

94
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:07,675
What did I take from you?

95
00:06:07,847 --> 00:06:09,296
My heart.

96
00:06:12,162 --> 00:06:14,162
Have you listened to my song?

97
00:06:14,162 --> 00:06:15,206
I have.

98
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,610
What’s your answer?

99
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:18,656
I didn’t finish it.

100
00:06:18,656 --> 00:06:19,988
I listened to the first two verses

101
00:06:19,988 --> 00:06:21,440
then I turned it off. I didn’t want to listen anymore.

102
00:06:22,618 --> 00:06:25,960
So you don’t know what I ask you in the song.

103
00:06:26,139 --> 00:06:27,277
No, I don’t.

104
00:06:27,596 --> 00:06:28,458
It’s okay.

105
00:06:28,796 --> 00:06:29,976
I can sing it to you here.

Be considerate of others.

111
00:06:48,261 --> 00:06:50,261
Do you want Kai Palo? I’ll give you two eggs.

112
00:06:50,578 --> 00:06:51,616
Can I have three?

113
00:06:51,616 --> 00:06:52,823
You can have as many as you want.

114
00:06:54,793 --> 00:06:56,004
Now go.

115
00:06:56,666 --> 00:06:57,455
What?

116
00:06:57,571 --> 00:06:59,200
I sang it to you with my heart.

(Sorry, Moo. I really am not ready.)

118
00:07:06,113 --> 00:07:07,180
Seriously, Kang?

119
00:07:07,320 --> 00:07:09,247
I wrote a song for you but you wouldn’t listen to it.

120
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:10,916
What can I do to make you listen to it?

121
00:07:25,769 --> 00:07:26,941
Did I steal your spot again?

122
00:07:29,024 --> 00:07:29,780
Hey.

123
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:32,687
It’s not that.

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:35,802
Then what?

125
00:07:37,207 --> 00:07:38,253
Tae wants to talk to you.

126
00:07:39,724 --> 00:07:40,678
I…

127
00:07:43,064 --> 00:07:44,868
I want to thank you for yesterday.

128
00:07:44,868 --> 00:07:46,356
Thanks for helping us skip school.

129
00:07:50,119 --> 00:07:50,957
Keep eating.

130
00:07:52,648 --> 00:07:55,967
Payos told me you were punished by the director.

131
00:07:55,967 --> 00:07:57,998
You got punished for us.

132
00:07:58,293 --> 00:07:59,184
Sorry.

133
00:07:59,503 --> 00:08:00,514
Sorry.

134
00:08:02,823 --> 00:08:03,560
No worries.

135
00:08:03,658 --> 00:08:04,350
Forget it.

136
00:08:04,889 --> 00:08:05,539
Sit down.

137
00:08:11,376 --> 00:08:13,646
How was the audition? Did you pass?

138
00:08:17,584 --> 00:08:18,348
No?

139
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:22,298
I think you guys dance too fast.

140
00:08:22,298 --> 00:08:23,545
That’s why your moves are not clean.

141
00:08:23,545 --> 00:08:24,772
Your moves are also a bit offbeat.

142
00:08:24,772 --> 00:08:25,957
Hey.

143
00:08:26,358 --> 00:08:27,879
I said too much.

144
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:29,047
No, no.

145
00:08:29,047 --> 00:08:29,588
Ignore it.

146
00:08:29,588 --> 00:08:30,620
Not at all.

147
00:08:31,184 --> 00:08:33,071
Everything you said is true.

148
00:08:33,659 --> 00:08:36,418
I know it too but I just can’t fix it yet.

149
00:08:37,622 --> 00:08:38,549
Here’s my suggestion.

150
00:08:38,990 --> 00:08:41,215
Don’t dance to the song yet.

151
00:08:41,583 --> 00:08:43,880
Just count the beats and make sure you’re in sync with each other first.

152
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:45,393
Once you’ve mastered that, you can start dancing to the song.

153
00:08:46,007 --> 00:08:47,004
Thanks.

154
00:08:47,470 --> 00:08:48,473
What a great technique.

155
00:08:48,668 --> 00:08:49,521
Thank you.

156
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,184
By the way, I heard TTM’s New Wave Project is coming up soon.

157
00:08:54,184 --> 00:08:55,000
Really?

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:08:55,714
Yes.

159
00:08:55,714 --> 00:08:57,274
A friend of mine is an insider.

160
00:08:57,274 --> 00:08:58,211
He told me about it.

161
00:08:58,603 --> 00:09:00,227
I really want to apply

162
00:09:00,227 --> 00:09:03,706
but if my mom finds out, she’ll scold me.

163
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,360
Yos, we need to practice harder for this opportunity.

164
00:09:08,337 --> 00:09:10,337
Moo, thank you so much.

165
00:09:11,049 --> 00:09:13,500
If there’s anything we can help you with, you can always tell us.

166
00:09:13,745 --> 00:09:15,828
If you ever need anything in the future, just let us know.

167
00:09:16,808 --> 00:09:17,664
Can I ask for your help today?

168
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,819
Today?

169
00:09:21,466 --> 00:09:24,515
My crush wouldn’t listen to the song I wrote for him.

170
00:09:25,111 --> 00:09:27,471
I want him to listen to it. What should I do?

171
00:09:29,019 --> 00:09:29,755
Who is he?

172
00:09:30,907 --> 00:09:31,550
It’s…

173
00:09:35,594 --> 00:09:36,436
Kang?

174
00:09:36,672 --> 00:09:37,453
Yeah.

175
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:39,677
Oh, Moo.

176
00:09:39,677 --> 00:09:40,869
You’re quite something.

177
00:09:41,041 --> 00:09:42,428
Kang is top tier.

178
00:09:42,700 --> 00:09:43,658
Yeah.

179
00:09:43,658 --> 00:09:46,475
I sent him my song, but he wouldn’t open it.

180
00:09:46,475 --> 00:09:48,033
And when I went to sing it to him earlier,

181
00:09:48,033 --> 00:09:49,166
he shooed me away.

182
00:09:49,362 --> 00:09:51,048
What can I do to make him listen to my song?

183
00:09:51,356 --> 00:09:53,943
Moo, you’re asking the right person.

184
00:09:56,688 --> 00:09:57,729
I know just what to do.

185
00:10:02,753 --> 00:10:05,934
First, we need to get into the broadcasting club room.

186
00:10:06,228 --> 00:10:07,132
Why?

187
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:09,037
To perform the song for Kang.

188
00:10:09,699 --> 00:10:10,639
I’m telling you,

189
00:10:10,639 --> 00:10:13,504
if you perform it from there, whether he wants to listen or not,

190
00:10:13,504 --> 00:10:15,050
he’ll hear it no matter which corner of the school he's in.

191
00:10:15,050 --> 00:10:16,678
What a brilliant idea, Tae.

192
00:10:16,678 --> 00:10:18,353
Like he said, you asked the right person.

193
00:10:18,623 --> 00:10:20,832
Tae is an expert in this area.

194
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:23,352
Excuse me.

195
00:10:23,483 --> 00:10:24,466
Can I walk you to class?

196
00:10:32,940 --> 00:10:33,957
What are you doing here?

197
00:10:33,957 --> 00:10:35,784
Oh, I forgot something here.

198
00:10:49,087 --> 00:10:51,528
But after Kang hears my song,

199
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:54,175
how do I know how he feels about me?

200
00:10:54,445 --> 00:10:55,633
You’re asking for a lot.

201
00:10:56,025 --> 00:10:56,905
I got you.

202
00:10:58,401 --> 00:11:01,700
While you’re singing, give us a video call.

203
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:03,663
I’ll show it to Kang.

204

Hello, people of Pathom Pittaya.

00:11:06,228 --> 00:11:09,170

212
00:11:15,725 --> 00:11:16,654
Moo?

213
00:11:16,997 --> 00:11:19,269
There’s one song I really want to sing to someone.

214
00:11:19,392 --> 00:11:21,387
Please listen to my song, Kang.

215
00:11:21,387 --> 00:11:22,463
Stop it, Moo!

216
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:23,949
You can’t run from me anymore.

217
00:11:23,949 --> 00:11:25,268
You have to listen to me.

218
00:11:25,391 --> 00:11:27,580
Hey, listen to him.

219
00:11:27,948 --> 00:11:29,024

Kang.

236
00:12:25,555 --> 00:12:26,948
What do you think? Is my song any good?

237
00:12:27,928 --> 00:12:30,562
Is it so good that you had to see me?

238
00:12:30,832 --> 00:12:32,419
You’re going to get scolded for singing like that.

239
00:12:32,591 --> 00:12:33,631
No.

240
00:12:33,803 --> 00:12:35,000
It’s a broadcasting room.

241
00:12:35,000 --> 00:12:35,833
Everyone can use it.

242
00:12:35,833 --> 00:12:37,400
Have you come around to accept my love?

243
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:38,849
This is not the time to talk about that.

244
00:12:38,849 --> 00:12:39,640
Let’s go.

245
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:40,359
Where are we going?

246
00:12:40,359 --> 00:12:41,293
The director’s going to come here.Hurry.

247
00:12:41,293 --> 00:12:42,094
Answer me first.

248
00:12:48,368 --> 00:12:49,391
The director!

249
00:12:50,368 --> 00:12:51,713
What are you doing in the primary grade building?

250
00:12:52,911 --> 00:12:53,928
Get inside the locker.

251
00:12:53,928 --> 00:12:54,788
The locker?

252
00:12:59,315 --> 00:13:00,241
Hurry and get inside.

253
00:13:00,927 --> 00:13:01,829
Hi.

254
00:13:14,230 --> 00:13:15,201
It’s locked, huh?

255
00:13:32,685 --> 00:13:34,685
Do you think you can get away with it by locking up the room?

256
00:13:36,593 --> 00:13:37,517
These are keys for the whole school.

257
00:13:39,344 --> 00:13:40,148
It’s not this one.

258
00:13:41,070 --> 00:13:43,761
Teacher Joei didn’t bother to label any of these keys!

259
00:13:49,447 --> 00:13:50,391
Om.

260
00:13:50,761 --> 00:13:52,480
Haha!

261
00:13:53,615 --> 00:13:55,096
I’m like a janitor carrying this keyring.

262
00:13:57,565 --> 00:13:59,519
Hey, Mok!

263
00:13:59,963 --> 00:14:01,149
Where are you hiding?

264
00:14:01,816 --> 00:14:03,171
Be a good boy and come out.

265
00:14:17,362 --> 00:14:18,274
Why are you smiling?

266
00:14:21,608 --> 00:14:22,701
I’m shy.

267
00:14:24,578 --> 00:14:26,970
I’ve never been this close to you.

268
00:14:33,234 --> 00:14:37,451
I’m glad you heard my song now.

269
00:14:38,142 --> 00:14:38,929
Keep it down.

270
00:14:38,929 --> 00:14:40,316
This is not the time to talk.

271
00:14:42,168 --> 00:14:43,240
Fine, I won’t talk

272
00:14:46,104 --> 00:14:46,845

Kang,

276
00:15:13,188 --> 00:15:14,395
I really like you.

277
00:15:15,506 --> 00:15:16,577
I like you so much.

278
00:15:19,046 --> 00:15:23,111
I like you because you’re kind.

279
00:15:23,613 --> 00:15:26,716
I like you because you’re cute.

280
00:15:27,482 --> 00:15:29,984
I like you because of who you are.

281
00:15:31,564 --> 00:15:32,739
I really like you.

282
00:15:38,566 --> 00:15:40,928
Are you sure you don’t like me yet?

283
00:15:42,362 --> 00:15:44,374
Kang, are you sure you don’t like me back?

284
00:15:46,646 --> 00:15:47,557
Kang.

285
00:15:50,643 --> 00:15:53,879
Ah.

286
00:15:54,768 --> 00:15:55,802
Mr. Mok.

287
00:15:56,049 --> 00:15:58,044
Come out right now.

288
00:15:58,563 --> 00:16:00,065
You’re surrounded.

289
00:16:00,929 --> 00:16:05,043
If you don’t come out and I open it and see you,

290
00:16:05,389 --> 00:16:06,844
you’ll get harsher punishment.

291
00:16:09,412 --> 00:16:10,328
It’s okay.

292
00:16:10,649 --> 00:16:11,351
I’ll go out.

293
00:16:11,351 --> 00:16:12,074
You stay here.

294
00:16:12,762 --> 00:16:13,495
Moo.

295
00:16:23,866 --> 00:16:24,864
I’m sorry, Director.

296
00:16:28,716 --> 00:16:29,614
Alright.

297
00:16:29,984 --> 00:16:31,707
At least you own up to your actions.

298
00:16:32,942 --> 00:16:38,570
But you can’t just keep making mistakes and getting punished without improving yourself.

299
00:16:42,200 --> 00:16:45,585
Looks like I need to call your mother over.

300
00:16:46,078 --> 00:16:48,030
But I just performed the song.

301
00:16:48,030 --> 00:16:49,609
Do you really have to call my parent?

302
00:16:49,767 --> 00:16:53,118
Aren’t we normally allowed to broadcast music from this room?

303
00:16:53,562 --> 00:16:55,909
Yes, but only at certain times.

304
00:16:55,909 --> 00:16:59,085
And only the members of the broadcasting club are allowed.

305
00:16:59,085 --> 00:17:01,592
Not anyone can just come in here and play music as they please.

306
00:17:05,148 --> 00:17:06,274
Strict, isn’t it?

307
00:17:06,643 --> 00:17:08,816
Please don’t go that far.

308
00:17:09,091 --> 00:17:11,179
Can you please just punish me without telling my mom?

309
00:17:11,426 --> 00:17:14,066
If she finds out, I’ll be transferred to another school.

310
00:17:20,289 --> 00:17:24,220
I get that as a teenager, you’re at the age where you want to defy conventions.

311
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:26,146
But listen, Mok,

312
00:17:26,739 --> 00:17:31,829
in addition to the conventions, there are social rules.

313
00:17:32,362 --> 00:17:36,442
These are agreements that everyone must abide by for society to function.

314
00:17:36,763 --> 00:17:38,794
You have to learn those too.

315
00:17:41,455 --> 00:17:42,117
Got it.

316
00:17:42,362 --> 00:17:43,922
You’re in grade 12 now.

317
00:17:44,258 --> 00:17:46,258
In only a few months, you’re going to university.

318
00:17:46,741 --> 00:17:49,111
Are you really going to have fun day by day?

319
00:17:49,731 --> 00:17:51,731
You should focus on your studies.

320
00:17:52,362 --> 00:17:55,739
Soon, no one will push you like this.

321
00:17:56,529 --> 00:17:59,309
Learn to prioritize what’s important to your life already.

322
00:18:01,606 --> 00:18:02,202
Got it.

323
00:18:04,968 --> 00:18:05,771
Alright.

324
00:18:06,611 --> 00:18:07,999
Follow me to my office.

325
00:18:08,394 --> 00:18:12,562
Finish physics practice questions before lunch break.

326
00:18:12,688 --> 00:18:14,442
You can’t ask anyone to help.

327
00:18:14,566 --> 00:18:16,518
I’ll have Teacher Joei watch you.

328
00:18:16,518 --> 00:18:17,362
Do you understand?

329
00:18:18,251 --> 00:18:19,177
Director.

330
00:18:19,918 --> 00:18:24,976
If I give you 200 baht, could you not punish me?

331
00:18:26,211 --> 00:18:27,196
How about 600?

332
00:18:27,196 --> 00:18:28,539
Go get the practice questions.

333
00:18:33,453 --> 00:18:34,958
Carry the keys for me.

334
00:18:35,106 --> 00:18:35,877

00:26:54,614 --> 00:26:57,923
Oh, your Kai Palo is my favorite.

505
00:27:00,043 --> 00:27:03,376
(This means Kang has come around to accept my love for sure.)

506
00:27:03,909 --> 00:27:05,909
(Oh, Moo. You’re getting a boyfriend!)

507
00:27:13,393 --> 00:27:16,272
Kang, you set up such a great vibe.

508
00:27:16,502 --> 00:27:17,850
Is there something you want to tell me?

509
00:27:19,784 --> 00:27:21,333
Bouncy eggs. Soft chicken.

510
00:27:21,333 --> 00:27:22,349
Juicy tofu.

511
00:27:22,349 --> 00:27:23,445
So sweet.

512
00:27:23,907 --> 00:27:25,584
Today is extra sweet, isn’t it?

513
00:27:27,452 --> 00:27:28,066
Moo.

514
00:27:28,367 --> 00:27:29,023
Yes?

515
00:27:29,826 --> 00:27:31,063
How was school today?

516
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:35,323
Not only did you cook for me, but you also cared and asked about my day.

517
00:27:36,378 --> 00:27:37,800
I asked because I’m concerned.

518
00:27:38,855 --> 00:27:40,113
Did you understand your lessons at all?

519
00:27:40,662 --> 00:27:41,623
Of course.

520
00:27:41,623 --> 00:27:44,871
I don’t want to brag, but I paid the most attention in class.

521
00:27:45,918 --> 00:27:46,855
Let me ask you then.

522
00:27:48,196 --> 00:27:49,259
What's Big Bang?

523
00:27:49,587 --> 00:27:50,169
That’s easy.

524
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:51,247
King of K-pop.

525
00:27:51,247 --> 00:27:52,868
The icon. The Korean legend.

526
00:27:52,868 --> 00:27:53,537
Who’s your bias?

527
00:27:53,537 --> 00:27:54,168
Mine is GD.

528
00:27:54,168 --> 00:27:54,949
I’ve loved him since I was a kid.

529
00:27:54,949 --> 00:27:56,900
I mean the theory about the origin of the universe.

530
00:27:57,168 --> 00:27:59,487
Oh, why so serious?

531
00:27:59,487 --> 00:28:01,177
I’m asking about your studies.

532
00:28:01,177 --> 00:28:01,897
Tell me.

533
00:28:02,008 --> 00:28:03,295
What does the theory mean?

534
00:28:05,075 --> 00:28:06,867
It means…

535
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:10,293
What are the characteristics of medieval civilization?

536
00:28:12,247 --> 00:28:14,960
How many ways can you find the limit of a function?

537
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:19,901
What's the sentence structure of present simple tense?

538
00:28:21,450 --> 00:28:22,754
The rice is so soft.

539
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:24,539
How did you cook it so softly?

540
00:28:25,487 --> 00:28:27,389
You can’t answer any of my questions.

541
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:29,885
I thought you said you paid attention in class.

542
00:28:32,632 --> 00:28:36,178
Sometimes I did, sometimes I didn’t.

543
00:28:37,948 --> 00:28:39,948
Your face was the only thing on my mind.

544
00:28:40,660 --> 00:28:42,361
Do you like me that much?

545
00:28:42,867 --> 00:28:43,803
The most in the world.

546
00:28:46,250 --> 00:28:47,986
I want you to stay away from me.

547
00:28:48,608 --> 00:28:50,402
Stop flirting with me. Stop hitting on me.

548
00:28:50,929 --> 00:28:54,546
From now on, we’re only food seller and customer.

549
00:28:58,201 --> 00:29:00,293
All you do is chase after me and not focus on your studies.

550
00:29:00,293 --> 00:29:01,618
You couldn’t answer any of my questions.

551
00:29:01,846 --> 00:29:04,007
You wanted me to listen to the song you wrote for me

552
00:29:04,088 --> 00:29:05,447
so badly that you broke the rules.

553
00:29:05,447 --> 00:29:07,871
The director punished you and is even going to all your parents.

554
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:10,563
How do you think I should feel?

555
00:29:12,431 --> 00:29:13,944
Glad? Shy?

556
00:29:15,614 --> 00:29:16,895
Happy that you’re doing too much?

557
00:29:17,444 --> 00:29:18,069
Huh?

558
00:29:22,135 --> 00:29:23,501
You’re mad at me, aren’t you?

559
00:29:25,479 --> 00:29:26,484
I’m not mad.

560
00:29:28,506 --> 00:29:30,425
I just don’t want you to waste time because of me.

561
00:29:36,359 --> 00:29:40,164
I think what you should do is spend time focusing on your studies

562
00:29:40,867 --> 00:29:42,128
so your mom doesn't have to worry.

563
00:29:44,414 --> 00:29:46,958
Then she will be accepting of you following your dream.

564
00:29:51,222 --> 00:29:52,592
Only then can you think about me.

565
00:29:57,295 --> 00:30:00,242
I hope you understand my intention.

566
00:30:15,714 --> 00:30:18,038
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

567
00:30:22,381 --> 00:30:24,996
Do you think I did the right thing?

568
00:30:26,887 --> 00:30:28,285
You already did it anyway.

569
00:30:28,594 --> 00:30:29,735
Why are you asking me?

570
00:30:30,247 --> 00:30:33,749
If I said what you did wasn’t right, you wouldn’t be able to change anything.

571
00:30:35,156 --> 00:30:39,055
Moo will come to understand that I did it out of good intention.

572
00:30:43,671 --> 00:30:49,102
Is your good intention hurting yourself though?

573
00:30:49,948 --> 00:30:51,509
I know you like him too.

574
00:30:51,807 --> 00:30:53,299
You almost gave in, didn’t you?

575
00:30:54,398 --> 00:30:55,195
Forget it.

576
00:30:55,327 --> 00:30:56,257
I’ll be fine.

577
00:30:57,007 --> 00:30:59,843
I know what I did was right

578
00:31:00,524 --> 00:31:01,822
and good for him.

579
00:31:01,822 --> 00:31:02,828
I had to do it.

580
00:31:03,180 --> 00:31:03,931
Gosh!

581
00:31:04,327 --> 00:31:08,392
I really want to give you a certificate of being a good person with clean hands.

582
00:31:17,007 --> 00:31:18,637
Is this really the end?

583
00:31:57,566 --> 00:31:59,550
Hey, am I interrupting your time?

584
00:32:00,231 --> 00:32:01,140
Not at all.

585
00:32:02,129 --> 00:32:03,866
We’re practicing dancing to Jang’s song.

586
00:32:03,998 --> 00:32:05,768
We plan to use it for the New Wave audition.

587
00:32:06,735 --> 00:32:08,834
Moo, you’re a true insider.

588
00:32:09,669 --> 00:32:10,625
You weren’t kidding.

589
00:32:13,306 --> 00:32:15,685
How’s your progress from this morning?

590
00:32:16,037 --> 00:32:17,799
Your song is the talk of the school now.

591
00:32:18,502 --> 00:32:19,602
Did Kang accept your love?

592
00:32:24,239 --> 00:32:25,000
Well…

593
00:32:35,396 --> 00:32:37,013
I want you to stay away from me.

594
00:32:37,694 --> 00:32:39,418
Stop flirting with me. Stop hitting on me.

595
00:32:40,121 --> 00:32:43,877
I think what you should do is spend time focusing on your studies

596
00:32:44,558 --> 00:32:47,206
so your mom will be accepting of you following your dream.

597
00:32:55,931 --> 00:33:08,282
[Shone: I’m waiting for your answer.]

598
00:33:09,178 --> 00:33:14,432
[Kang:   I can do Saturday or Sunday.]

599
00:33:14,943 --> 00:33:20,350
[Shone: See you this Saturday then.]

600
00:33:24,345 --> 00:33:25,376
(Act normal.)

601
00:33:25,750 --> 00:33:27,159
(Just return his jacket and that’s it.)

602
00:33:31,311 --> 00:33:31,926
Moo.

603
00:33:34,387 --> 00:33:37,442
Auntie, can I have rice vermicelli and chicken?

604
00:33:40,400 --> 00:33:41,508
Hi, Kang.

605
00:33:41,508 --> 00:33:42,971
Can we have two of the usual?

606
00:33:48,025 --> 00:33:50,767
Moo will probably stay away from your stall for a while.

607
00:33:54,391 --> 00:33:55,351
That’s his business.

608
00:33:55,747 --> 00:33:58,060
I just called him to get his jacket back.

609
00:33:58,873 --> 00:34:00,259
Can you guys return it to him?

610
00:34:00,259 --> 00:34:01,624
Return it yourself.

611
00:34:03,031 --> 00:34:03,683
Don’t worry.

612
00:34:03,847 --> 00:34:04,997
I can return it for you.

613
00:34:04,997 --> 00:34:06,314
Thanks.

614
00:34:19,188 --> 00:34:20,968
Here’s your jacket.

615
00:34:22,008 --> 00:34:23,019
Kang wanted to return it to you.

616
00:34:28,286 --> 00:34:30,572
Can I have Kai Palo and sour soup?

617
00:34:30,572 --> 00:34:31,443
Sure.

618
00:34:37,635 --> 00:34:39,767
(Won’t he turn around to look at me at all?)

619
00:34:40,067 --> 00:34:42,485
The noodles are delicious.

620
00:34:43,551 --> 00:34:45,903
Rich flavor. Good meatball.

621
00:34:46,568 --> 00:34:47,281
Good chicken.

622
00:34:50,534 --> 00:34:51,469
The noodles are delicious, huh?

623
00:34:54,237 --> 00:34:57,578
(But this is good. This is for the best.)

624
00:35:00,133 --> 00:35:01,567
What’s on the menu today, Kang?

625
00:35:01,832 --> 00:35:04,843
Today I have green curry, sour soup, clear soup,

626
00:35:05,039 --> 00:35:07,039
and Kai Palo.

627
00:35:10,031 --> 00:35:10,652
Hey.

628
00:35:11,817 --> 00:35:12,641
Did you hear that?

629
00:35:12,641 --> 00:35:13,548
Kai Palo is on the menu.

630
00:35:13,841 --> 00:35:15,841
Not Kai Palo again, Kang.

631
00:35:15,998 --> 00:35:17,405
You should change it to something else. It’s boring now.

632
00:35:19,551 --> 00:35:20,408
What should I eat?

633
00:35:22,100 --> 00:35:24,100
The first type of radiation is alpha rays,

634
00:35:24,624 --> 00:35:27,833
consisting of helium nucleus particles.

635
00:35:28,305 --> 00:35:30,305
Alpha particles have an atomic mass of approximately 4 u.

636
00:35:31,101 --> 00:35:36,705
Note that beta particles are high-energy electrons with low mass and high energy,

637
00:35:37,343 --> 00:35:41,263
resulting in low ionization potential.

638
00:35:42,560 --> 00:35:44,877
5, 6, 7, 8.

639
00:35:44,877 --> 00:35:46,065
1, 2,

640
00:35:46,065 --> 00:35:47,289
3, 4,

641
00:35:47,289 --> 00:35:48,282
5, 6,

642
00:35:48,384 --> 00:35:49,421
7, 8.

643
00:35:53,905 --> 00:35:54,807
Is that enough?

644
00:35:54,880 --> 00:35:55,945
I think we can dance to the song now.

645
00:35:55,945 --> 00:35:56,616
Let’s do it.

646
00:35:56,616 --> 00:35:57,464
- Yes, let’s go.
- You sure?

647
00:35:58,023 --> 00:35:58,582
Okay.

648
00:35:58,805 --> 00:35:59,981
I’m tired already.

649
00:36:00,311 --> 00:36:00,849
Come on.

650
00:36:02,007 --> 00:36:03,480
The jumps are so tiring.

651
00:36:35,622 --> 00:36:36,716
Woo!

652
00:36:37,617 --> 00:36:38,508
That’s amazing.

653
00:36:41,660 --> 00:36:43,484
Come on, let’s dance one more time.

654
00:36:47,576 --> 00:36:49,400
Let’s keep practicing until it’s second nature.

655
00:36:50,257 --> 00:36:50,862
Go!

656
00:37:00,673 --> 00:37:02,585
You sold well today, Kang.

657
00:37:02,585 --> 00:37:04,391
Only Kai Palo is left.

658
00:37:04,808 --> 00:37:07,087
I made more of it than the other dishes.

659
00:37:07,191 --> 00:37:09,523
Oh? Why did you make a lot of it?

660
00:37:10,116 --> 00:37:13,430
Someone likes it, so I made extra, just in case.

661
00:37:14,111 --> 00:37:16,663
I just made Kai Palo too.

662
00:37:16,854 --> 00:37:18,700
I’ll check out other places then.

663
00:37:18,700 --> 00:37:19,451
Sure.

664
00:37:34,764 --> 00:37:36,258
Can I have Kai Palo with rice?

665
00:37:50,167 --> 00:37:51,815
How come you can come to my food stall now?

666
00:37:54,542 --> 00:37:55,908
You’ve been gone for a few days.

667
00:37:57,008 --> 00:38:02,625
Do you know pretending like I don’t care about you these past few days has been torture?

668
00:38:05,608 --> 00:38:07,878
How’s your progress from this morning?

669
00:38:08,343 --> 00:38:10,093
Your song is the talk of the school now.

670
00:38:10,812 --> 00:38:11,982
Did Kang accept your love?

671
00:38:16,466 --> 00:38:17,310
Well…

672
00:38:20,715 --> 00:38:21,862
There, there.

673
00:38:22,348 --> 00:38:23,532
It’s okay.

674
00:38:26,578 --> 00:38:29,506
No wonder you look so down.

675
00:38:32,213 --> 00:38:33,406
Don’t worry.

676
00:38:34,654 --> 00:38:36,366
He said that because he’s worried about you.

677
00:38:37,191 --> 00:38:38,567
It’s not that he doesn’t accept your feelings.

678
00:38:38,694 --> 00:38:40,598
He just wants you to do what he said.

679
00:38:40,704 --> 00:38:41,346
That’s it.

680
00:38:42,361 --> 00:38:42,861
Yeah.

681
00:38:44,468 --> 00:38:45,335
I’ll do it.

682
00:38:47,746 --> 00:38:48,595
That’s our friend.

683
00:38:49,935 --> 00:38:50,607
Yeah.

684
00:38:50,967 --> 00:38:53,167
And don’t worry about your studies.

685
00:38:53,167 --> 00:38:53,910
I’ll help you.

686
00:38:53,910 --> 00:38:55,014
Yeah, he’s smart.

687
00:38:55,162 --> 00:38:57,138
Don’t ask Potae. He doesn’t know anything.

688
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:01,013
Stop.

689
00:39:01,330 --> 00:39:02,238
Don’t go over your friend’s head.

690
00:39:02,238 --> 00:39:03,484
Don’t stress.

691
00:39:03,484 --> 00:39:04,633
Drink some water. Come on.

692
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:06,017
Drink some water.

693
00:39:06,796 --> 00:39:07,781
Drink some water.

694
00:39:08,427 --> 00:39:09,710
Feeling refreshed now, buddy?

695
00:39:13,581 --> 00:39:14,298
Yos!

696
00:39:14,648 --> 00:39:17,431
He enjoyed it so much that it came out of his mouth.

697
00:39:18,072 --> 00:39:18,892
It’s okay.

698
00:39:19,167 --> 00:39:20,347
You guys made me feel better.

699
00:39:26,767 --> 00:39:27,381
Here’s your jacket.

700
00:39:28,396 --> 00:39:29,507
Kang wanted to return it to you.

701
00:39:38,152 --> 00:39:40,152
Guys, he made it smell so good.

702
00:39:41,785 --> 00:39:42,766
Don’t be distracted.

703
00:39:43,464 --> 00:39:44,483
Be strong, Moo.

704
00:39:47,123 --> 00:39:50,900
Put it down.

705
00:40:01,408 --> 00:40:02,885
The noodles are delicious.

706
00:40:03,139 --> 00:40:03,873
Rich flavor.

707
00:40:04,048 --> 00:40:04,918
Good meatball.

708
00:40:05,287 --> 00:40:06,057
Good chicken.

709
00:40:07,376 --> 00:40:08,657
Let me just walk past.

710
00:40:09,588 --> 00:40:12,647
Today I have green curry, sour soup, clear soup,

711
00:40:12,843 --> 00:40:14,843
and Kai Palo.

712
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:15,861
Hey.

713
00:40:15,861 --> 00:40:16,764
Did you hear that?

714
00:40:16,764 --> 00:40:17,639
Kai Palo is on the menu.

715
00:40:18,658 --> 00:40:20,658
Not Kai Palo again, Kang.

716
00:40:20,898 --> 00:40:22,433
You should change it to something else. It’s boring now.

717
00:40:24,678 --> 00:40:26,256
(Hang in there, Moo. Hang in there.)

718
00:40:26,489 --> 00:40:27,497
(Don’t turn around, Moo.)

719
00:40:30,189 --> 00:40:31,083
That’s amazing.

720
00:40:32,500 --> 00:40:33,162
Hey!

721
00:40:34,151 --> 00:40:34,854
Kang!

722
00:40:35,277 --> 00:40:37,843
Moo, you’re so talented!

723
00:40:39,625 --> 00:40:40,149
Focus.

724
00:40:45,394 --> 00:40:45,971
Focus.

725
00:40:46,394 --> 00:40:47,187
Okay.

726
00:40:47,481 --> 00:40:48,596
Let’s dance one more time.

727
00:40:48,767 --> 00:40:49,826
We’re born to dance.

728
00:40:49,826 --> 00:40:50,974
So we’ll dance.

729
00:40:50,974 --> 00:40:52,145
We’ll keep dancing.

730
00:40:52,145 --> 00:40:53,207
We’ll dance all day.

731
00:40:53,207 --> 00:40:55,417
We’ll dance some more because we’re not tired yet.

732
00:40:55,417 --> 00:40:56,743
We’ll dance and dance again.

733
00:40:56,847 --> 00:40:57,694
That’s it.

734
00:41:03,394 --> 00:41:04,759
It’s been killing me

735
00:41:05,412 --> 00:41:07,412
but I think I can see you today.

736
00:41:08,968 --> 00:41:10,108
I have something to show you.

737
00:41:14,062 --> 00:41:14,922
Look, Kang.

738
00:41:15,522 --> 00:41:17,127
I didn’t fail any subject.

739
00:41:17,348 --> 00:41:18,305
My scores are good.

740
00:41:26,219 --> 00:41:28,869
I studied the entire week for the Physics exam.

741
00:41:29,128 --> 00:41:30,895
It took me only two days to study for Maths.

742
00:41:30,895 --> 00:41:33,641
Surprisingly, I’m a math genius.

743
00:41:34,731 --> 00:41:36,223
Why are you showing me this?

744
00:41:36,811 --> 00:41:38,642
Because of what you told me.

745
00:41:40,294 --> 00:41:46,436
You said I need to focus on my studies and my dream before thinking of you.

746
00:41:48,403 --> 00:41:51,671
Before, I’ve rarely succeeded in anything I did.

747
00:41:51,925 --> 00:41:56,599
But now, I want to show you that I can do it.

748
00:41:59,876 --> 00:42:00,831
Good.

749
00:42:01,856 --> 00:42:05,566
I’m still working towards my dream,

750
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:10,315
but If I pass the audition, you must be honest with your heart.

751
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:13,881
What are you saying, Moo?

752
00:42:16,356 --> 00:42:21,700
I know how you feel about me.

753
00:42:24,540 --> 00:42:26,223
Take your school report back.

754
00:42:29,902 --> 00:42:30,853
Come on, Kang.

755
00:42:31,447 --> 00:42:32,360
That day,

756
00:42:35,405 --> 00:42:37,783
your heart was beating so fast.

757
00:42:39,454 --> 00:42:42,963
That heartbeat was definitely more than just nervousness.

758
00:42:43,957 --> 00:42:49,740
Your heartbeat matched mine when I was close to you.

759
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,478
I’m glad you heard my song now.

760
00:43:03,953 --> 00:43:04,895
You’re exaggerating.

761
00:43:06,101 --> 00:43:07,335
But you’re smiling.

762
00:43:08,689 --> 00:43:10,666
I’m only smiling because you’re doing better.

763
00:43:13,056 --> 00:43:15,751
I’m a better person because of you.

764
00:43:25,205 --> 00:43:28,440
You did very well, smarty.

765
00:43:32,416 --> 00:43:33,674
I’m so happy.

766
00:43:38,598 --> 00:43:41,541
I have something to tell you too.

767
00:43:43,719 --> 00:43:44,579
What is it?

768
00:43:46,189 --> 00:43:50,939
I’ve been making Kai Palo every day, waiting for you to come and eat it.

769
00:43:51,088 --> 00:43:52,050
Did you hear that?

770
00:43:52,050 --> 00:43:52,847
Kai Palo is on the menu.

771
00:43:59,168 --> 00:44:01,591
That means you’ve missed me too.

772
00:44:02,058 --> 00:44:02,975
Admit it.

773
00:44:04,181 --> 00:44:05,607
You’ve been making Kai Palo, waiting for me to come and eat it.

774
00:44:06,876 --> 00:44:09,846
You’re also wearing a cap with Kai Palo embroidery today.

775
00:44:10,206 --> 00:44:10,762
Am I right?

776
00:44:15,753 --> 00:44:16,779
Am I right?

777
00:44:17,583 --> 00:44:19,490
Don’t be shy. Say it.

778
00:44:19,765 --> 00:44:20,480
Yeah.

779
00:44:21,898 --> 00:44:22,924
I’ve missed you.

780
00:44:28,682 --> 00:44:31,097
Kang, can I ask for something?

781
00:44:33,323 --> 00:44:33,961
What is it?

782
00:44:35,607 --> 00:44:39,588
It’s okay that we’re not a couple yet,

783
00:44:41,238 --> 00:44:44,322
but can you please hold off on dating anyone else?

784
00:44:50,875 --> 00:44:52,387
Wait for me to win your heart.

785
00:44:57,874 --> 00:44:58,868
Can you?

786
00:45:13,581 --> 00:45:14,111
Of course.

787
00:45:43,942 --> 00:45:45,424
(Kang said he’d give me a chance.)

788
00:45:45,424 --> 00:45:47,354
(Now I’m motivated to follow my dream.)

789
00:45:47,523 --> 00:45:49,375
We passed the audition, didn’t we?

790
00:45:49,536 --> 00:45:50,118
Yes.

791
00:45:53,367 --> 00:45:54,785
I’ll visit you this Saturday.

792
00:45:55,635 --> 00:45:57,165
I know my mom.

793
00:45:57,165 --> 00:45:58,291
She won’t sign it.

794
00:45:58,291 --> 00:46:00,876
Yos and I will persuade her.

795
00:46:01,045 --> 00:46:02,704
Hi, Mom.

796
00:46:03,064 --> 00:46:05,945
(I have both my dream and my love to fight for.)

797
00:46:06,622 --> 00:46:07,464
You can do it for sure.

798
00:46:07,464 --> 00:46:09,327
I’m always rooting for you here.

799
00:46:09,581 --> 00:46:13,019
(Because Kang does this, I’ll give it my all!)

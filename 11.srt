4
00:00:18,041 --> 00:00:20,659
The contract says I can’t date.

5
00:00:21,176 --> 00:00:22,399
So what do we have to do?

6
00:00:22,634 --> 00:00:25,737
We just have to pretend we don’t know each other when we’re outside.

7
00:00:25,737 --> 00:00:27,433
That’s enough to hide it from people.

8
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,264
Someone dug up a clip of you with your boyfriend and leaked it.

9
00:00:30,440 --> 00:00:34,271
The company has found out about you and Moo dating in secret.

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:36,427
We’ll get through this together.

11
00:00:36,779 --> 00:00:37,832
Let’s break up.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:39,200
Kang, don’t let go of my hand.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:39,910
Kang.

14
00:00:40,544 --> 00:00:41,542
Who gave me this?

15
00:00:41,683 --> 00:00:42,823
One of your fans.

16
00:00:42,964 --> 00:00:43,870
Did you draw it yourself?

17
00:00:43,870 --> 00:00:46,488
I saw him draw at a university festival.

18
00:00:46,797 --> 00:00:47,714
Which university?

19
00:00:53,358 --> 00:00:55,559
[Rooting for you, Payos.]

20
00:00:56,005 --> 00:00:56,840
Wow, Jang.

21
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:58,590
I can’t believe they gave us food support as a couple.

22
00:00:59,741 --> 00:01:00,410
I know, right?

23
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:01,624
I just saw it too.

24
00:01:01,624 --> 00:01:02,542
This is cute.

25
00:01:02,706 --> 00:01:04,132
I knew there would be.

26
00:01:04,226 --> 00:01:06,368
You two are inseparable.

27
00:01:06,368 --> 00:01:08,634
I knew someday people would ship you together.

28
00:01:11,593 --> 00:01:12,619
Hello?

29
00:01:14,356 --> 00:01:15,000
Excuse me.

30
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:15,521
Yes?

31
00:01:15,850 --> 00:01:17,549
Who gave me this?

32
00:01:17,807 --> 00:01:19,188
One of your fans.

33
00:01:19,752 --> 00:01:20,860
He dropped it just now.

34
00:01:21,071 --> 00:01:21,669
Did he leave just now?

35
00:01:21,669 --> 00:01:22,169
Yes.

36
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:25,000
I can’t eat anything.

37
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,504
I can’t eat carbs. I can’t eat sweets.

38
00:01:27,161 --> 00:01:29,768
Payos, how about we take some photos to thank the fans?

39
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:30,626
Sure.

40
00:01:30,626 --> 00:01:31,179
Great.

41
00:01:33,198 --> 00:01:34,131
Hey.

42
00:01:34,413 --> 00:01:35,610
You don’t need to take photos of the food.

43
00:01:35,704 --> 00:01:38,506
At this rate, just take photos of yourselves together.

44
00:01:39,539 --> 00:01:43,102
Alright. Could you take photos of me and Payos?

45
00:01:43,666 --> 00:01:44,304
Here.

46
00:01:46,370 --> 00:01:46,937
Let’s go.

47
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:48,776
Come here.

48
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,127
I’ll go do something else outside.

49
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:52,626
Would you like to eat anything?

50
00:01:52,626 --> 00:01:53,440
Feel free to grab whatever you want.

51
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:54,951
Take the burger too.

52
00:01:55,702 --> 00:01:56,624
I can’t eat it.

53
00:01:57,640 --> 00:01:58,432
Come on.

54
00:02:03,340 --> 00:02:04,073
Ready?

55
00:02:04,355 --> 00:02:07,443
3, 2, 1.

56
00:02:11,951 --> 00:02:12,678
Okay.

57
00:02:15,133 --> 00:02:18,225
Potae, I think we should take a thank you video too.

58
00:02:23,414 --> 00:02:24,095
Go ahead.

59
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:27,600
Thank you so much for your food support for me and Payos.

60
00:02:27,600 --> 00:02:29,796
These are all Payos’ favorites.

61
00:02:31,534 --> 00:02:33,169
These are Jang’s favorites too.

62
00:02:33,826 --> 00:02:35,279
I’ll steal all from him.

63
00:02:35,279 --> 00:02:36,717
Don’t do that.

64
00:02:41,648 --> 00:02:43,378
Alright. Let me see.

65
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:46,709
Payos, look.

66
00:02:46,709 --> 00:02:47,645
Where did you run off to?

67
00:02:48,866 --> 00:02:49,990
I know where Kang is.

68
00:02:52,573 --> 00:02:53,975
I’m finally going to see Kang.

69
00:02:58,530 --> 00:02:59,873
Kang, what?

70
00:03:00,624 --> 00:03:02,916
Kang definitely drew this.

71
00:03:02,916 --> 00:03:04,152
I remember his style.

72
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:06,238
I just ran to the fan.

73
00:03:06,426 --> 00:03:09,994
He said he hired him to draw this at a university festival.

74
00:03:10,675 --> 00:03:11,816
The festival is on today.

75
00:03:12,098 --> 00:03:14,048
If I make it there in time, I’m definitely going to see Kang.

76
00:03:14,494 --> 00:03:15,623
Let’s go.

77
00:03:15,716 --> 00:03:16,446
Yes.

78
00:03:17,479 --> 00:03:18,822
Are you really going to see him, Moo?

79
00:03:25,232 --> 00:03:25,923
Jang,

80
00:03:27,238 --> 00:03:30,127
he and I are really not together anymore.

81
00:03:31,254 --> 00:03:32,707
I haven’t talked to him for a year.

82
00:03:33,083 --> 00:03:35,929
If you don’t believe me, you can check my phone.

83
00:03:36,563 --> 00:03:37,646
No need.

84
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:41,465
I just miss him.

85
00:03:42,169 --> 00:03:44,183
I just want to see him. Can’t I do that?

86
00:03:45,897 --> 00:03:48,246
You do know there are limits to what you can do, right?

87
00:03:49,890 --> 00:03:50,797
Yes, I do.

88
00:03:51,642 --> 00:03:54,356
I promise I won’t get our band in trouble.

89
00:03:55,765 --> 00:03:57,890
Then hurry there and come back quickly.

90
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:00,279
I will. Thank you, Jang.

91
00:04:04,647 --> 00:04:08,873
Moo, I want to go with you but I have singing practice with Jang.

92
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:09,554
It’s okay.

93
00:04:09,554 --> 00:04:10,981
You don’t have to go with him. I will.

94
00:04:10,981 --> 00:04:12,067
I’m free today.

95
00:04:13,382 --> 00:04:14,430
I don’t have anything to do anyway.

96
00:05:33,407 --> 00:05:37,525
EP 11: WE ALL TRY

97
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:39,227
See you next time.

98
00:05:39,227 --> 00:05:40,568
- Bye.
- Bye.

99
00:05:42,564 --> 00:05:43,197
Come here.

100
00:05:44,841 --> 00:05:46,494
When will you talk to Yos the same way again?

101
00:05:46,588 --> 00:05:47,549
It’s been a year already.

102
00:05:49,427 --> 00:05:51,373
I want to talk to him the same way.

103
00:05:51,890 --> 00:05:53,121
I thought we were back to normal.

104
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:55,742
And…

105
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,198
what are your feelings now?

106
00:06:02,481 --> 00:06:03,133
Friends?

107
00:06:03,767 --> 00:06:04,428
Yeah.

108
00:06:12,365 --> 00:06:13,521
(Just friends?)

109
00:06:15,493 --> 00:06:16,607
But it turns out we aren’t.

110
00:06:20,857 --> 00:06:25,129
As you can see, he ends up being closer to Jang than me.

111
00:06:26,162 --> 00:06:28,126
So I don’t care anymore.

112
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,746
I don’t think Yos has feelings for Jang.

113
00:06:31,192 --> 00:06:32,426
But I think Jang does.

114
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:34,399
Jang is the senior.

115
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,543
He knows the rules. He won’t break them.

116
00:06:36,919 --> 00:06:39,282
He just takes care of all of us.

117
00:06:39,517 --> 00:06:41,594
When I’m sick, he takes care of me too.

118
00:06:42,134 --> 00:06:43,174
I don’t think so.

119
00:06:44,489 --> 00:06:45,254
Tae.

120
00:06:45,888 --> 00:06:46,893
Forget it.

121
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:48,971
Let’s talk about you and Kang.

122
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:52,554
I thought you said you wouldn’t think about him again.

123
00:06:53,047 --> 00:06:55,174
Actually, I have always thought about him.

124
00:06:56,301 --> 00:06:57,753
I just didn’t tell you.

125
00:07:01,886 --> 00:07:02,806
It’s not like that.

126
00:07:03,064 --> 00:07:04,833
It’s not that I don’t see you as a friend.

127
00:07:05,256 --> 00:07:06,309
I just didn’t want to talk about it.

128
00:07:06,849 --> 00:07:07,807
It makes me sad.

129
00:07:12,503 --> 00:07:14,690
After he broke up with me at the metro,

130
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,336
Take good care of yourself.

131
00:07:18,336 --> 00:07:19,426
Don’t get sick.

132
00:07:19,731 --> 00:07:20,633
Kang.

133
00:07:22,206 --> 00:07:23,563
Don’t forget to love yourself.

134
00:07:32,110 --> 00:07:34,091
Are you really going to break up with me, Kang?

135
00:07:37,191 --> 00:07:41,654
Sorry, the number you’ve dialed is not available at this moment.

136
00:07:41,983 --> 00:07:44,087
I tried every way to contact Kang.

137
00:07:45,519 --> 00:07:46,621
I looked for him.

138
00:07:47,780 --> 00:07:49,138
I went to our old school.
[For Sale]

139
00:07:55,501 --> 00:07:56,715
I went to his house.

140
00:07:57,889 --> 00:07:58,891
But I couldn’t find him.

141
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,432
I thought I was definitely going to find him at my university,

142
00:08:13,747 --> 00:08:14,679
but I didn’t.

143
00:08:15,665 --> 00:08:19,746
I heard that he withdrew from studying at the same place as me.

144
00:08:21,249 --> 00:08:24,325
I’m sure he did that to avoid me.

145
00:08:30,853 --> 00:08:35,576
You know, you’ve been with me since the day I had no one

146
00:08:36,398 --> 00:08:40,256
until now, when I see my Everest.

147
00:08:41,407 --> 00:08:44,902
I’m not climbing it alone. You’re climbing it with me.

148
00:09:44,905 --> 00:09:46,073
I’ve missed you so much.

149
00:09:47,153 --> 00:09:49,113
I’ve missed being near you.

150
00:09:49,817 --> 00:09:51,218
Kissing you.

151
00:09:52,627 --> 00:09:53,612
I love you.

152
00:09:54,575 --> 00:09:55,589
I love you too.

153
00:10:03,931 --> 00:10:06,132
I’ll never let go of your hand.

154
00:10:07,564 --> 00:10:08,670
I promise.

155
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:14,429
In the end, he let go of my hand.

156
00:10:38,977 --> 00:10:40,122
I get you.

157
00:10:40,686 --> 00:10:42,183
It must not have been easy.

158
00:10:44,507 --> 00:10:45,410
It’s okay.

159
00:10:46,114 --> 00:10:47,129
I’m going to see him soon.

160
00:10:48,726 --> 00:10:49,682
Let’s go.

161
00:11:03,536 --> 00:11:04,036
Hi.

162
00:11:04,036 --> 00:11:04,536
Hi.

163
00:11:04,536 --> 00:11:05,427
Could you draw this?

164
00:11:06,014 --> 00:11:06,877
Let me see.

165
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,034
This photo is easy.

166
00:11:09,316 --> 00:11:10,935
You can text it to me.

167
00:11:10,935 --> 00:11:12,003
I’ll take care of it.

168
00:11:13,294 --> 00:11:13,851
Done.

169
00:11:14,086 --> 00:11:14,785
Okay.

170
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:21,754
I think he should be around here.

171
00:11:22,693 --> 00:11:23,330
Yeah.

172
00:11:23,447 --> 00:11:24,561
Let’s go and find him.

173
00:11:25,688 --> 00:11:26,209
Come on.

174
00:11:30,717 --> 00:11:31,737
Hey, that’s Kang.

175
00:11:33,507 --> 00:11:35,257
Guys, that’s Moo and Potae!

176
00:11:36,642 --> 00:11:39,083
Can we get a photo with you, please?

177
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:40,767
Can we get a photo with you, please?

178
00:11:41,987 --> 00:11:43,069
Can we use this phone too?

179
00:11:46,169 --> 00:11:47,475
Can we get a photo with you?

180
00:11:48,132 --> 00:11:48,891
You’re so cute.

181
00:11:48,891 --> 00:11:50,130
Thank you so much.

182
00:11:50,130 --> 00:11:51,130
Thank you.

183
00:11:51,294 --> 00:11:52,499
Please excuse us.

184
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,002
Can I get a photo too?

185
00:11:56,326 --> 00:11:57,152
Thank you.

186
00:11:57,152 --> 00:11:58,190
Thank you.

187
00:11:59,036 --> 00:11:59,956
Thank you.

188
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:05,569
Tae, he’s gone.

189
00:12:06,226 --> 00:12:07,743
Yeah. Where did he go?

190
00:12:10,889 --> 00:12:11,928
I think he’s still here somewhere.

191
00:12:16,906 --> 00:12:17,512
I have an idea.

192
00:12:18,451 --> 00:12:20,103
Even though I can’t see him today,

193
00:12:20,667 --> 00:12:22,301
he will see me.

194
00:12:22,559 --> 00:12:23,138
How?

195
00:12:23,420 --> 00:12:23,920
Hey!

196
00:12:23,920 --> 00:12:24,585
Moo!

197
00:12:30,427 --> 00:12:32,761
There's this song I want to sing to someone.

198
00:12:34,316 --> 00:12:37,391
Even though I don’t know if he’s here or not,

199
00:12:38,220 --> 00:12:40,141
I want him to hear it.

200
00:12:41,774 --> 00:12:44,901
because this song was inspired by him.

201
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:48,804
Someone I haven’t seen for a whole year.

202
00:12:51,162 --> 00:12:54,007

I’m okay with the design.

246
00:17:11,770 --> 00:17:13,057
Shone, can you start the car?

247
00:17:13,057 --> 00:17:13,839
Now!

248
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,339
What?

249
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:15,849
I’ll tell you in the car.

250
00:17:15,849 --> 00:17:16,802
Oh, okay.

251
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:17,610
I’ll call you back.

252
00:17:17,610 --> 00:17:18,348
Okay.

253
00:17:26,071 --> 00:17:26,640
Moo!

254
00:17:28,273 --> 00:17:29,214
Moo!

255
00:17:33,827 --> 00:17:34,805
Where were you running to?

256
00:17:35,720 --> 00:17:37,486
Kang came to watch me earlier.

257
00:17:37,486 --> 00:17:38,531
He really came.

258
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:40,192
I ran after him closely.

259
00:17:42,576 --> 00:17:44,389
Damn it. I missed my chance again.

260
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,592
At least you know where he’s studying now.

261
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:49,383
There’s always a next time.

262
00:17:55,810 --> 00:17:57,329
Was that some kind of event at your university?

263
00:17:58,106 --> 00:17:58,863
Thank you.

264
00:17:59,951 --> 00:18:00,976
It’s a festival.

265
00:18:01,287 --> 00:18:03,948
Each faculty set up booths to sell stuff.

266
00:18:04,129 --> 00:18:05,240
There was also a concert.

267
00:18:09,127 --> 00:18:10,348
Did something happen?

268
00:18:11,203 --> 00:18:12,766
You looked worried earlier.

269
00:18:15,824 --> 00:18:17,348
I saw Moo at the university.

270
00:18:23,361 --> 00:18:24,169
Are you okay?

271
00:18:25,517 --> 00:18:26,914
We didn’t talk.

272
00:18:27,536 --> 00:18:31,118
I got away in time.

273
00:18:32,854 --> 00:18:33,733
It’s for the best.

274
00:18:34,459 --> 00:18:36,390
You’ve managed to avoid him for a year.

275
00:18:40,121 --> 00:18:41,198
Come on. Let’s eat.

276
00:18:41,198 --> 00:18:42,346
Let me prepare it for you.

277
00:18:43,486 --> 00:18:44,694
Thank you.

When I’m not home, don’t sneak out to sell food.

282
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,112
If you hurt your back, no one is going to take you to the doctor.

283
00:19:00,578 --> 00:19:02,428
I’m not complaining. I’m worried about you.

284
00:19:02,800 --> 00:19:03,913
Talk later.

285
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,162
I’m going back to my dorm now.

286
00:19:06,017 --> 00:19:06,738

Watch out.

292
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:36,196
Sorry.

293
00:19:36,559 --> 00:19:37,167
Sorry.

00:19:51,315 --> 00:19:52,200
I’m good.

298
00:19:52,977 --> 00:19:54,509
Do you still go to the same faculty?

299
00:19:54,509 --> 00:19:57,326
Or did you change faculties when you switched universities?

300
00:19:59,710 --> 00:20:00,533
Still the same.

301
00:20:00,533 --> 00:20:01,573
Painting.

302
00:20:04,165 --> 00:20:06,018
How long has it been since you last saw Moo?

303
00:20:06,718 --> 00:20:09,059
You almost crashed into their popcorn earlier.

304
00:20:13,309 --> 00:20:14,194
Several months.

305
00:20:15,982 --> 00:20:17,082
You guys don’t talk at all?

306
00:20:20,240 --> 00:20:23,653
Moo has become an idol like he dreams of.

307
00:20:24,793 --> 00:20:28,355
I have to live my life, focus on my studies,

308
00:20:29,443 --> 00:20:31,992
do what I love, and pursue my own dreams too.

309
00:20:35,076 --> 00:20:35,869
That’s good.

310
00:20:36,465 --> 00:20:37,381
Keep moving forward.

311
00:20:40,128 --> 00:20:40,628
Yes.

312
00:20:44,075 --> 00:20:45,010
Are you going anywhere after this?

313
00:20:45,865 --> 00:20:46,417
Well,

314
00:20:46,702 --> 00:20:47,976
How about grabbing something to eat with me?

315
00:20:48,157 --> 00:20:49,034
My treat.

316
00:20:50,874 --> 00:20:51,899
No, thank you.

317
00:20:52,365 --> 00:20:53,385
I don’t want to trouble you.

318
00:20:56,210 --> 00:20:57,928
I parked in front of your faculty.
[4 MONTHS EARLIER]

319
00:21:01,608 --> 00:21:02,716
Hi, Shone.

320
00:21:02,716 --> 00:21:03,252
Hi.

321
00:21:03,252 --> 00:21:04,841
Did you call me because you need anything?

322
00:21:05,048 --> 00:21:08,310
Oh, I have something for you.

323
00:21:08,854 --> 00:21:10,376
I’ve wanted to give you this for so long

324
00:21:10,376 --> 00:21:13,737
but back then you were with Moo, so I was too scared.

325
00:21:15,447 --> 00:21:18,012
Since you two ended things some time ago,

326
00:21:18,634 --> 00:21:20,673
I guess I can give it to you now.

327
00:21:24,042 --> 00:21:25,930
Though you cannot be in Moo’s dream,

328
00:21:26,526 --> 00:21:28,770
please know that you always have me in yours.

329
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,162
By the way, would eating with just the two of us

330
00:22:11,965 --> 00:22:14,710
make people think we’re dating?

331
00:22:15,695 --> 00:22:18,370
Never mind what people think.

332
00:22:19,199 --> 00:22:23,357
As long as we know in our hearts that

333
00:22:23,590 --> 00:22:25,430
we’re not together.

334
00:22:27,348 --> 00:22:28,303
Whoa.

335
00:22:30,375 --> 00:22:34,340
Don’t you want what people think to come true at all?

336
00:22:36,336 --> 00:22:37,621
Not again, Shone.

337
00:22:40,135 --> 00:22:41,357
I’m just flirting a bit.

338
00:22:41,357 --> 00:22:43,419
Just in case you want to change your mind and give me a chance.

339
00:22:43,911 --> 00:22:45,870
Fine. I’ll stop flirting and talk about work instead.

340
00:22:46,388 --> 00:22:48,592
Have you seen what I sent you?

341
00:22:49,110 --> 00:22:49,782
Yes, I have.

342
00:22:51,286 --> 00:22:54,537
I want a new logo for my show to give that vibe.

343
00:22:54,848 --> 00:22:58,786
If you have any ideas, you can send me your draft.

344
00:23:00,419 --> 00:23:01,362
Sure.

345
00:23:26,760 --> 00:23:30,304
[There’s congee in the fridge in case you’re hungry when you get back late.]

346
00:23:44,791 --> 00:23:45,383
Don’t.

347
00:23:45,590 --> 00:23:47,123
No.

348
00:23:50,129 --> 00:23:51,277
It’s a bad dream, Tae.

349
00:23:52,624 --> 00:23:53,623
It’s just a dream.

350
00:23:57,112 --> 00:23:58,335
It’s just a dream, okay?

351
00:24:09,126 --> 00:24:10,311
Did I have a bad dream again?

352
00:24:12,047 --> 00:24:12,857
Yeah.

353
00:24:14,412 --> 00:24:15,577
Don’t worry.

354
00:24:16,950 --> 00:24:17,779
Go back to sleep.

355
00:24:22,626 --> 00:24:24,003
Can you not go yet?

356
00:24:25,195 --> 00:24:26,400
I don’t want to be alone.

357
00:24:31,150 --> 00:24:32,432
Can you not go yet?

358
00:24:33,624 --> 00:24:36,519
I have only you who’s always with me.

359
00:24:38,100 --> 00:24:41,565
Can you wait until I fall asleep before you go?

360
00:24:43,220 --> 00:24:44,644
Please don’t leave me.

361
00:24:45,888 --> 00:24:46,959
In my dream,

362
00:24:48,177 --> 00:24:50,863
you fought with me

363
00:24:52,029 --> 00:24:53,420
and left me.

364
00:24:55,390 --> 00:24:56,892
You won’t leave me, right?

365
00:25:00,132 --> 00:25:01,322
Please stay with me for now.

366
00:25:03,266 --> 00:25:04,581
Please don’t leave me.

367
00:25:13,885 --> 00:25:16,585

I’ve been looking for you for a whole year.

Finally, I get to see you today.

Why have you been looking for me?

389
00:27:29,718 --> 00:27:30,604
I missed you.

390
00:27:32,018 --> 00:27:33,889
I want you to be a part of my success.

391

Why are you bothering me again?

392

We already broke up.

393
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:48,165
It was over a long time ago.

394

Kang, did you really not miss me?

I’ve been avoiding you and cutting contact.

Everything I’ve been doing should give you a clear enough answer.

Come on, Kang.

398
00:28:10,821 --> 00:28:12,005
I know you’re lying.

399
00:28:19,574 --> 00:28:21,126
Accept the truth, Moo.

400
00:28:22,471 --> 00:28:23,978

Why do you keep fiddling with it?

00:29:00,197 --> 00:29:03,522
Do you think I was too heartless for saying that to Moo?

409
00:29:04,470 --> 00:29:06,777
Heartless. Mean. Evil.

410
00:29:07,040 --> 00:29:07,605
Hey,

411
00:29:07,812 --> 00:29:08,875
I’m your friend.

412
00:29:08,978 --> 00:29:09,950
Why did you say that to me?

413
00:29:10,553 --> 00:29:12,491
You asked me if you were heartless.

414
00:29:12,732 --> 00:29:13,809
I just gave you my answer.

415
00:29:14,085 --> 00:29:17,651
But I understand that you want Moo to move on.

416
00:29:17,910 --> 00:29:19,441
I get that.

417
00:29:20,475 --> 00:29:24,803
Sometimes, we have to act heartless, even though we don’t want to.

418
00:29:27,182 --> 00:29:27,907
Yeah.

419
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:30,113
What about you, though?

420
00:29:31,423 --> 00:29:32,986
You want Moo to move on from you

421
00:29:33,331 --> 00:29:35,551
but have you moved on from him?

422
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:43,514
This is your wallet, right, Moo?

423
00:29:43,842 --> 00:29:44,342
Yes.

424
00:29:44,342 --> 00:29:44,842
Right? Okay.

425
00:29:44,842 --> 00:29:47,735
May I ask for your consent to open it?

426
00:29:47,735 --> 00:29:48,252
Of course.

427
00:29:48,252 --> 00:29:51,032
I can open it? Okay. Please let me.

428
00:29:52,325 --> 00:29:57,893
You have one, two, three, four hundred baht.

429
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,525

Oh, this must be your childhood photo, Moo.

434
00:30:17,631 --> 00:30:18,851
You had such a straight face here.

435
00:30:19,144 --> 00:30:20,948
You’re so cute with this straight face.

436

See? He’s so cute.

437

Yes.

Yeah.

505
00:35:43,494 --> 00:35:44,324
What did you say?

506
00:35:45,137 --> 00:35:46,629
It’d be great if you knew his password.

507
00:35:49,131 --> 00:35:50,128
Wait, I know it.

508
00:35:50,299 --> 00:35:50,930
You do?

509
00:35:50,930 --> 00:35:51,531
Yes.

510
00:35:51,531 --> 00:35:53,163
I created that password for him myself.

511
00:35:54,276 --> 00:35:55,309
Then log in.

512
00:35:55,531 --> 00:35:56,138
Is it the correct one?

513
00:35:56,138 --> 00:35:56,758
I got in.

514
00:35:59,134 --> 00:35:59,735
Here it is.

515
00:36:01,148 --> 00:36:01,855
Yeah.

516
00:36:09,969 --> 00:36:10,935
Hi, everyone.

517
00:36:10,935 --> 00:36:13,208
I’m starting a new show.

518
00:36:13,291 --> 00:36:17,884
I can't tell you what it is yet but I can show you the face of the guy helping me with the logo.

519
00:36:22,101 --> 00:36:22,992
See you soon.

520
00:36:25,197 --> 00:36:25,978
Who is he?

521
00:36:26,513 --> 00:36:28,535
I’m doing this because I’m worried about you.

522
00:36:28,728 --> 00:36:30,657
Don’t get me wrong, okay?

523
00:36:30,978 --> 00:36:32,451
Accept the truth, Moo.

524
00:36:33,050 --> 00:36:34,710
You and I are nothing to each other anymore.

525
00:36:39,771 --> 00:36:40,648
Hey.

526
00:36:41,034 --> 00:36:41,820
What’s wrong?

527
00:36:42,312 --> 00:36:43,074
I can’t take it, Tae.

528
00:36:43,481 --> 00:36:44,279
Hey.

529
00:36:44,279 --> 00:36:45,000
Calm down.

530
00:36:45,150 --> 00:36:46,284
I’ll get you water.

531
00:36:46,284 --> 00:36:46,891
Calm down.

532
00:36:46,891 --> 00:36:47,637
Just a moment.

533
00:37:00,871 --> 00:37:02,072
[Bro, we need to talk.]

534
00:37:20,312 --> 00:37:21,450
Moo, here’s your water.

535
00:37:28,664 --> 00:37:29,987
What’s wrong, Tae?

536
00:37:31,100 --> 00:37:31,868
Here’s your water.

537
00:37:32,639 --> 00:37:33,490
Thanks.

538
00:37:37,558 --> 00:37:38,756
I got you guys coffee.

539
00:37:40,404 --> 00:37:42,000
This is for you, Moo.

540
00:37:42,731 --> 00:37:43,839
Thank you.

541
00:37:44,203 --> 00:37:45,222
This is for you, Potae.

542
00:37:47,470 --> 00:37:48,411
I’m not thirsty.

543
00:37:48,839 --> 00:37:49,670
I don’t want to have to pee.

Kang.

569
00:39:53,006 --> 00:39:54,011
Is it really you?

570
00:39:55,724 --> 00:39:56,344
Kang.

571
00:40:02,023 --> 00:40:02,994
I’m sorry.

572
00:40:07,104 --> 00:40:08,648
Please don’t move.

573
00:40:10,395 --> 00:40:11,030
Okay.

574

I don’t know who has been sending these for a year.

You've never been able to forget Moo, right?

593
00:41:44,891 --> 00:41:46,347
It must be your fan.

594
00:41:46,347 --> 00:41:47,389
It only talks to you.

595
00:41:49,744 --> 00:41:50,804

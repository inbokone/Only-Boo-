4
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,212
We’re sorry, Master,

5
00:00:19,212 --> 00:00:21,301
for being rude to you this morning.

6
00:00:21,438 --> 00:00:23,523
We just found out who your mom is.

7
00:00:24,621 --> 00:00:26,619
Why do you want to dance so much?

8
00:00:27,058 --> 00:00:30,857
Have you ever heard of the saying, “Everyone has their own Everest”?

9
00:00:30,857 --> 00:00:32,740
I want to be a world-class artist.

10
00:00:32,877 --> 00:00:33,554
Here.

11
00:00:33,554 --> 00:00:34,708
You can borrow this.

12
00:00:34,708 --> 00:00:35,956
I said I don’t want it.

13
00:00:35,956 --> 00:00:37,439
Can you please accept my kindness?

14
00:00:37,439 --> 00:00:38,863
Hey, I said I don’t want it!

15
00:00:39,028 --> 00:00:41,330
And don’t bring up drawing again.

16
00:00:41,824 --> 00:00:43,486
(Kang got angry for no reason.)

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:46,780
(From now on, I’ll slap and crush them like how I’d slap a volleyball.)

18
00:00:51,479 --> 00:00:52,599
Why can’t I sleep?

19
00:00:53,422 --> 00:00:56,772
(Why am I so restless that I can’t sleep because I don’t want him to be mad at me?)

20
00:01:10,467 --> 00:01:13,528
(Damn. Don’t tell me I’ve fallen for Kang.)

21
00:01:15,614 --> 00:01:16,563
Seriously?

22
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:28,764
I wake up at 3 a.m. to buy ingredients for my mom to cook.

23
00:01:28,764 --> 00:01:30,098
My mom sells at the dorm.

24
00:01:30,098 --> 00:01:31,395
I sell at the school.

25
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:34,000
After school, I sell here.

26
00:01:42,827 --> 00:01:43,848
Is anyone here?

27
00:01:44,918 --> 00:01:46,261
Kang, are you up?

28
00:01:47,194 --> 00:01:48,000
Kang?

29
00:01:49,811 --> 00:01:51,480
Kang? Hello?

30
00:02:13,107 --> 00:02:15,027
Go away. Shoo!

31
00:02:20,516 --> 00:02:21,560
Moo?

32
00:02:23,124 --> 00:02:24,000
Kang.

33
00:02:24,412 --> 00:02:25,462
Where did you go?

34
00:02:26,779 --> 00:02:28,054
I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.

35
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:29,953
Why have you been waiting?

36
00:02:32,505 --> 00:02:33,452
I want to apologize to you.

37
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:36,544
I don’t know if I crossed any line

38
00:02:37,559 --> 00:02:38,966
but seeing how mad you were at me,

39
00:02:39,240 --> 00:02:41,590
I think you had your reasons.

40
00:02:42,304 --> 00:02:44,395
And I thought over what I did.

41
00:02:44,999 --> 00:02:45,951
It’s my fault.

42
00:02:46,862 --> 00:02:47,679
I’m sorry.

43
00:02:48,862 --> 00:02:49,908
It’s not your fault.

44
00:02:50,512 --> 00:02:52,841
I shouldn’t have taken my feelings out on you.

45
00:02:59,482 --> 00:03:00,087
Stop.

46
00:03:28,212 --> 00:03:29,234
What did you do?

47
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,913
It was just a mosquito.

48
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:33,383
I did what you told me to.

49
00:03:33,575 --> 00:03:34,768
I shooed it away and it left.

50
00:03:35,866 --> 00:03:37,289
But I’m not a mosquito.

51
00:03:38,414 --> 00:03:41,625
No matter how much you shoo me away, I won’t leave.

52
00:04:56,242 --> 00:04:59,532
EP 3: WEAK SPOT FOR YOU

53
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:01,772
Anyway, where did you go?

54
00:05:02,101 --> 00:05:03,304
I’ve been calling for you for a long time.

55
00:05:03,414 --> 00:05:04,498
I thought you were inside.

56
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:05,488
Where did you go?

57
00:05:08,068 --> 00:05:09,672
Don’t tell me

58
00:05:10,770 --> 00:05:13,633
you were so mad at me that you couldn’t sleep either.

59
00:05:13,640 --> 00:05:14,712
Moo,

60
00:05:14,822 --> 00:05:16,324
you’re getting carried away.

61
00:05:16,434 --> 00:05:17,594
Do you want me to scold you again?

62
00:05:17,594 --> 00:05:18,492
Go to bed.

63
00:05:18,492 --> 00:05:19,346
I’m going to the market.

64
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:20,729
I’m not sleepy anymore.

65
00:05:20,949 --> 00:05:22,853
Can I help you shop at the market?

66
00:05:22,853 --> 00:05:24,605
What can you possibly help me with?

67
00:05:25,264 --> 00:05:26,918
You can’t even clean the dishes thoroughly.

68
00:05:26,918 --> 00:05:28,493
I can learn to do that.

69
00:05:28,493 --> 00:05:30,277
Let me help you shop at the market.

70
00:05:30,497 --> 00:05:31,274
The stuff is going to be heavy.

71
00:05:31,274 --> 00:05:33,800
You can trust me with labor work.

72
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:34,431
There’s no need.

73
00:05:34,431 --> 00:05:35,474
I’d rather go alone.

74
00:05:35,474 --> 00:05:36,503
It’s much more convenient.

75
00:05:37,711 --> 00:05:38,948
I’m not leaving!

76
00:05:39,771 --> 00:05:41,109
Hey, why did you get on?

77
00:05:41,109 --> 00:05:41,840
Let’s go!

78
00:05:44,255 --> 00:05:45,865
Unbelievable.

79
00:05:55,279 --> 00:05:56,198
Have we arrived?

80
00:05:56,198 --> 00:05:57,375
Yes, we have.

81
00:06:16,614 --> 00:06:18,200
Hi, what can I get for you?

82
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:19,169
Hi.

83
00:06:19,320 --> 00:06:21,062
I’d like to get things on this list.

84
00:06:21,062 --> 00:06:21,914
The usual, please.

85
00:06:21,914 --> 00:06:23,299
Okay. You got it.

86
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:25,037
Kang.

87
00:06:25,586 --> 00:06:26,661
What is this?

88
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:28,400
Sweet basil.W

89
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,854
hat about me? Sweet babe?

90
00:06:29,854 --> 00:06:31,878
Put it down before I mess up your face.

91
00:06:33,744 --> 00:06:35,068
And what is this?

92
00:06:35,233 --> 00:06:36,238
Hom Hua Yai.

93
00:06:36,238 --> 00:06:37,080
Go ahead and kiss it.

94
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:38,556
It’s Hom Hua Yai as in onion, not Hom Hua Lai as in kiss a shoulder.

95
00:06:42,206 --> 00:06:42,793
Kang,

96
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:46,920
I won’t ask you what veggie this is because I know what it is.

97
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:47,618
What is it?

98
00:06:47,618 --> 00:06:49,520
Whether I get the veggie name right or wrong, I hope it’s not wrong to love you.

99
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,221
Oh, so sweet.

100
00:06:51,221 --> 00:06:54,657
I can’t believe I came up with that genius line.

101
00:06:54,760 --> 00:06:55,749
Right, Kang?

102
00:06:57,505 --> 00:06:58,346
Kang?

103
00:06:58,972 --> 00:06:59,882
Excuse me.

104
00:07:20,991 --> 00:07:22,139
Where is he?

105
00:07:22,551 --> 00:07:23,441
Is he lost?

106
00:07:25,252 --> 00:07:26,123
Are you looking for me?

107
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:38,620
Yes.

108
00:07:39,745 --> 00:07:40,824
Where did you go?

109
00:07:41,345 --> 00:07:42,428
You’re worried about me?

110
00:07:43,004 --> 00:07:43,687
No.

111
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:48,046
I went to buy this for you.

112
00:07:48,540 --> 00:07:51,018
These Pa Tong Go come in twos, but this Moo is still single.

113
00:07:53,049 --> 00:07:56,073
These buns are filled with black bean paste, but my heart is filled with love.

114
00:07:56,540 --> 00:07:59,320
These soybean milk come with toppings, but I come with loving care.

115
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,485
You’re smiling.

116
00:08:01,814 --> 00:08:03,079
What’s wrong with you?

117
00:08:03,518 --> 00:08:04,380
I want to see you smile.

118
00:08:04,380 --> 00:08:05,184
You’re smiling now.

119
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:07,000
Your expression makes me laugh.

120
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:08,448
Let’s go.

121
00:08:15,831 --> 00:08:16,635
Kang.

122
00:08:16,855 --> 00:08:17,355
Hmm?

123
00:08:17,355 --> 00:08:17,888
Kang.

124
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:18,900
Kang.

125
00:08:20,605 --> 00:08:21,504
You eat one half.

126
00:08:22,163 --> 00:08:25,721
I eat another half.

127
00:08:26,133 --> 00:08:26,932
So we can make a pair.

128
00:08:27,574 --> 00:08:28,668
What are you talking about?

129
00:08:48,670 --> 00:08:50,070
What are you doing?

130
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:51,530
I told you to sit tight.

131
00:08:51,859 --> 00:08:53,252
I’m enjoying the breeze.

132
00:08:53,252 --> 00:08:54,248
It’s so cool.

133
00:08:54,248 --> 00:08:55,505
Sit tight.

134
00:08:59,238 --> 00:09:00,248
Hey.

135
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:01,824
Why are you hugging me?

136
00:09:02,071 --> 00:09:03,448
You told me to sit tight.

137
00:09:26,804 --> 00:09:27,341
You okay?

138
00:09:27,341 --> 00:09:28,092
Let me help.

139
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:32,168
Kang!

140
00:09:33,156 --> 00:09:34,560
Kang, are you back?

141
00:09:35,658 --> 00:09:36,244
Oh,

142
00:09:37,095 --> 00:09:37,964
who is this?

143
00:09:38,348 --> 00:09:39,800
His name is Moo.

144
00:09:40,397 --> 00:09:41,589
Are you Kang’s mom?

145
00:09:41,781 --> 00:09:43,385
Hi.

146
00:09:43,849 --> 00:09:46,080
For a long time, I couldn’t tell if you were his mom.

147
00:09:46,278 --> 00:09:47,600
I thought you were his sister.

148
00:09:49,204 --> 00:09:50,760
Such a sweet talker.

149
00:09:51,304 --> 00:09:54,000
How did you two meet?

150
00:09:54,345 --> 00:09:56,949
I just moved to this dorm.

151
00:09:56,949 --> 00:09:59,186
I’ve been broke lately.

152
00:09:59,329 --> 00:10:01,938
My mom won’t send me money until the end of the month.

153
00:10:02,432 --> 00:10:05,263
Kang found out so he’s been kind enough to let me work for food.

154
00:10:05,647 --> 00:10:06,415
Really?

155
00:10:06,772 --> 00:10:08,692
He didn’t tell me.

156
00:10:08,870 --> 00:10:11,582
I’ve been meaning to but I forgot.

157
00:10:13,229 --> 00:10:15,116
Go take a shower, brush your teeth, and get ready for school.

158
00:10:15,253 --> 00:10:16,020
Go.

159
00:10:16,569 --> 00:10:17,465
Got it, Kang.

160
00:10:19,331 --> 00:10:21,357
Hurry to school. I want to eat.

161
00:10:21,756 --> 00:10:22,481
Bye.

162
00:10:22,646 --> 00:10:23,537
Bye.

163
00:10:24,367 --> 00:10:25,800
He’s a bit odd, isn’t he?

164
00:10:26,082 --> 00:10:27,600
You too, Kang.

165
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,885
You never wanted anyone to go to the market with you before.

166
00:10:31,297 --> 00:10:35,044
I tried to send him away before I left but he wouldn’t leave.

167
00:10:35,044 --> 00:10:37,439
I didn’t want to be late so I just let him tag along.

168
00:10:37,439 --> 00:10:38,654
I’m going to take these inside.

169
00:10:38,654 --> 00:10:39,376
Okay.

170
00:10:51,887 --> 00:10:53,887
Oh? I got a flat tire.

171
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,335
I better go with Kang.

172
00:10:56,719 --> 00:10:58,158
You live alone now.

173
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:00,367
You must learn to rely on yourself, you know?

174
00:11:21,967 --> 00:11:24,037
Hey, kid. We’ve arrived.

175
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:33,953
Let me do one song.

176
00:11:54,873 --> 00:11:58,800
♪ For me to stop loving you, just stop being lovely first ♪

177
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:02,941
♪ You’re too cute to handle, not loving you is impossible ♪

178
00:12:02,941 --> 00:12:05,093
♪ I’m already yours ♪

179
00:12:05,093 --> 00:12:10,276
♪ You can’t pretend to ignore me ♪

180
00:12:10,276 --> 00:12:15,021
♪ You tell me not to take it seriously, but you secretly do ♪

181
00:12:15,021 --> 00:12:19,128
♪ A bit cuter than this and I’ll become your slave ♪

182
00:12:19,128 --> 00:12:27,095
♪ The more I look at you, the cuter you get ♪

183
00:12:27,638 --> 00:12:31,477
♪ I’ll love you until my last breath ♪

184
00:12:35,396 --> 00:12:36,396
Wow, Master.

185
00:12:36,780 --> 00:12:38,440
You’re talented.

186
00:12:39,130 --> 00:12:39,954
You saw that?

187
00:12:40,750 --> 00:12:41,816
Yes, of course.

188
00:12:41,816 --> 00:12:43,267
I’ve been watching since you picked up the broom.

189
00:12:44,006 --> 00:12:44,787
You’re so cool.

190
00:12:44,952 --> 00:12:48,119
Our steps the other day couldn’t compare to yours.

191
00:12:48,311 --> 00:12:48,887
What?

192
00:12:48,887 --> 00:12:49,972
You’re a great dancer.

193
00:12:49,972 --> 00:12:51,487
Some of your moves that day were so difficult.

194
00:12:51,487 --> 00:12:52,758
You’re too kind, Master.

195
00:12:52,758 --> 00:12:53,809
Hey, Master.

196
00:12:53,809 --> 00:12:56,240
What are you and Payos talking about?

197
00:12:56,533 --> 00:12:57,387
Here.

198
00:12:57,607 --> 00:12:59,711
I brought fried chicken with sticky rice for you.

199
00:12:59,840 --> 00:13:01,221
This is from my go-to place.

200
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:04,826
Thank you.

201
00:13:04,826 --> 00:13:05,377
You’re welcome.

202
00:13:05,377 --> 00:13:06,446
Why did you buy me this?

203
00:13:06,748 --> 00:13:12,518
So you can eat it while watching our dance clips.

204
00:13:12,655 --> 00:13:14,821
You might like them and want to send them to your mom.

205
00:13:16,577 --> 00:13:17,626
That’s right, Master.

206
00:13:17,818 --> 00:13:19,864
Please send our clips to your mom for her consideration.

207
00:13:19,864 --> 00:13:20,935
Yes, please.

208
00:13:22,554 --> 00:13:26,129
But I don’t think I’m going to send her the clips.

209
00:13:26,200 --> 00:13:27,017
Oh?

210
00:13:27,993 --> 00:13:28,832
Why not?

211
00:13:29,381 --> 00:13:33,028
Because I actually got transferred here to correct my behavior.

212
00:13:33,138 --> 00:13:36,320
I’m ordered not to dance, sing, or get involved with any of it.

213
00:13:36,549 --> 00:13:38,631
Do you think I’m going to send my mom your clips and get told off?

214
00:13:39,657 --> 00:13:42,178
But you were dancing just now.

215
00:13:42,506 --> 00:13:44,745
Yes, I was, but my mom didn’t see that.

216
00:13:45,568 --> 00:13:53,672
If you’re hoping to benefit from my connections and talk to my mom,

217
00:13:54,001 --> 00:13:55,836
I don’t think it’s a good idea. It’s not going to work.

218
00:13:57,687 --> 00:13:58,679
If you’re not going to help,

219
00:13:59,687 --> 00:14:00,887
why didn’t you tell us from the beginning?

220
00:14:01,699 --> 00:14:03,150
I didn’t know how to tell you.

221
00:14:03,150 --> 00:14:04,881
You were so serious about your dancing.

222
00:14:05,493 --> 00:14:07,493
Don’t treat other people’s dreams as a joke.

223
00:14:07,926 --> 00:14:10,173
Tae! Calm down.

224
00:14:10,173 --> 00:14:11,216
Come with me.

225
00:14:15,724 --> 00:14:17,023
How am I wrong?

226
00:14:18,313 --> 00:14:19,900
I shouldn’t have been nice to him.

227
00:14:21,437 --> 00:14:24,196
Calm down, Mr. Tae.

228
00:14:25,458 --> 00:14:29,323
You don’t have to be so mad at him.

229
00:14:32,792 --> 00:14:34,408
How can I not be mad?

230
00:14:34,821 --> 00:14:36,000
You heard what he said.

231
00:14:36,756 --> 00:14:41,116
“If you want to use my mom’s connections, don’t bother. It’s not going to work.”

232
00:14:41,116 --> 00:14:44,002
“My mom doesn’t even allow me to dance. I dance behind her back.”

233
00:14:44,536 --> 00:14:45,877
He’s so fake.

234
00:14:47,102 --> 00:14:49,102
You’re always complaining.

235
00:14:49,401 --> 00:14:50,370
Blame him, not me.

236
00:14:51,538 --> 00:14:53,831
If he didn’t do that, I wouldn’t be complaining.

237
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,263
I think you’re hangry.

238
00:14:56,620 --> 00:14:57,788
I’m not hungry.

239
00:14:59,352 --> 00:15:00,000
Eat.

240
00:15:01,153 --> 00:15:02,156
Eat it.

241
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:06,305
While you eat, enjoy watching the birds and the trees.

242
00:15:07,348 --> 00:15:08,371
Let me feed you.

243
00:15:12,194 --> 00:15:15,113
I think this is for the best though.

244
00:15:15,497 --> 00:15:18,561
We can prove our talent without depending on others.

245
00:15:20,674 --> 00:15:21,608
You’re talented.

246
00:15:22,280 --> 00:15:23,087
Trust me.

247
00:15:25,020 --> 00:15:27,337
You understand everything about me.

248
00:15:28,852 --> 00:15:32,142
Shall we film a dance clip this evening?

249
00:15:32,577 --> 00:15:33,878
Let’s give it our all.

250
00:15:33,878 --> 00:15:34,577
Let’s do it.

251
00:15:37,619 --> 00:15:40,016
Enjoy your favorite food, Mr. Potae.

252
00:15:40,236 --> 00:15:40,948
It’s the best.

253
00:15:42,137 --> 00:15:42,950
Come on.

254
00:15:43,718 --> 00:15:44,843
Let me feed you too.

255
00:16:02,901 --> 00:16:04,134
(I didn’t sleep all night.)

256
00:16:04,601 --> 00:16:05,826
(Let me sleep for 5 minutes.

257
00:16:23,721 --> 00:16:25,119
)Shit! It’s 12:50!

258
00:16:25,119 --> 00:16:26,478
I don’t have time to eat now!

259
00:16:29,415 --> 00:16:30,696
Oh, Kang!

260
00:16:31,437 --> 00:16:32,452
What are you doing here?

261
00:16:32,726 --> 00:16:35,249
I brought you food because you didn’t come down to eat.

262
00:16:36,001 --> 00:16:36,960
How cute.

263
00:17:00,944 --> 00:17:02,148
I almost died.

264
00:17:02,331 --> 00:17:03,604
What’s wrong?

265
00:17:03,604 --> 00:17:04,502
Do you want to go to the infirmary?

266
00:17:04,611 --> 00:17:06,452
The infirmary can’t treat me.

267
00:17:06,452 --> 00:17:09,487
I saw your face so I was checking if I was dreaming.

268
00:17:14,279 --> 00:17:15,026
Seriously?

269
00:17:15,721 --> 00:17:17,181
Moo, you’re starting to scare me.

270
00:17:17,499 --> 00:17:20,551
You were checking if you were dreaming by covering your nose with your hand?

271
00:17:20,889 --> 00:17:23,971
They say if you cover your nose with your hand and you can breathe, you’re dreaming.

272
00:17:23,971 --> 00:17:25,152
I’m not dreaming.

273
00:17:25,192 --> 00:17:26,811
You brought me food.

274
00:17:26,812 --> 00:17:29,030
I’m so happy that you’re worried about me.

275
00:17:30,330 --> 00:17:31,121
I’m cute, aren’t I?

276
00:17:31,935 --> 00:17:33,799
[TOP TIER!]

277
00:17:39,114 --> 00:17:41,114
Your friends just let you sleep?

278
00:17:41,114 --> 00:17:42,533
No one woke you up and told you to go eat?

279
00:17:45,743 --> 00:17:46,681
Do you have friends?

280
00:17:49,312 --> 00:17:50,036
No.

281
00:17:51,572 --> 00:17:52,687
Is it because they don’t want to get to know you?

282
00:17:53,322 --> 00:17:54,539
I don’t know.

283
00:17:56,723 --> 00:17:59,656
Come on. You’ve been here for several days.

284
00:18:00,132 --> 00:18:01,563
Why don’t you try to make friends?

285
00:18:02,079 --> 00:18:03,270
I don’t want to have friends.

286
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:05,366
I want to have a boyfriend.

287
00:18:09,135 --> 00:18:10,113
Tell me honestly.

288
00:18:11,345 --> 00:18:12,440
Do you feel the same way I do?

289
00:18:12,797 --> 00:18:13,500
Have you finished eating?

290
00:18:13,691 --> 00:18:14,541
What’s the hurry?

291
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,531
I’m not in a hurry.

292
00:18:15,829 --> 00:18:16,585
I need to get back to my shop.

293
00:18:16,585 --> 00:18:17,403
I have a lot of customers.

294
00:18:17,403 --> 00:18:18,017
Don’t go yet.

295
00:18:18,017 --> 00:18:18,802
You’ve finished eating.

296
00:18:18,802 --> 00:18:19,854
- Don’t go yet.
- I’m leaving.

297
00:18:20,009 --> 00:18:20,972
Don’t go.

298
00:18:22,611 --> 00:18:24,204
I’m leaving. I’m in a hurry.

299
00:18:24,447 --> 00:18:25,034
Where are you going?

300
00:18:25,034 --> 00:18:26,586
Hey, Kang. There you are.

301
00:18:27,258 --> 00:18:29,040
I saw your partner waiting at the food stall.

302
00:18:29,813 --> 00:18:30,735
You’re seeing someone?

303
00:18:30,894 --> 00:18:31,718
Why do you want to know?

304
00:18:31,718 --> 00:18:32,411
Seriously?

305
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:33,057
I’m leaving.

306
00:18:33,593 --> 00:18:34,224
Hey.

307
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:36,509
Don’t follow me.

308
00:18:36,767 --> 00:18:37,412
Kang!

309
00:18:37,412 --> 00:18:38,470
Stay here and study.

310
00:18:39,463 --> 00:18:40,640
Hey, Mok.

311
00:18:41,867 --> 00:18:43,148
I need to talk to you about something.

312
00:18:43,148 --> 00:18:43,867
Of course.

313
00:18:43,867 --> 00:18:45,039
Can I go to the restroom first?

314
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:45,539
No.

315
00:18:45,539 --> 00:18:47,588
The class is about to start.

316
00:18:47,747 --> 00:18:48,450
Look at the time.

317
00:18:48,749 --> 00:18:49,845
Go to your seat.

318
00:18:55,882 --> 00:18:56,826
Where did you go?

319
00:18:57,565 --> 00:18:58,082
Oh,

320
00:18:58,459 --> 00:19:00,645
who did you bring food for?

321
00:19:01,837 --> 00:19:03,151
Why are you here?

322
00:19:03,489 --> 00:19:04,929
Who did you come here to gossip about this time?

323
00:19:05,326 --> 00:19:10,525
My class was canceled today and I missed you so I came here for your food.

324
00:19:12,821 --> 00:19:13,393
Neth.

325
00:19:13,393 --> 00:19:13,920
Hmm?

326
00:19:14,397 --> 00:19:17,520
Every time you come here without notice, you have a hidden agenda.

327
00:19:17,837 --> 00:19:18,337
I can tell.

328
00:19:21,217 --> 00:19:22,159
Okay.

329
00:19:22,814 --> 00:19:23,582
I’ll get to the point.

330
00:19:24,396 --> 00:19:27,640
Did you go to the market with Moo at dawn?

331
00:19:27,640 --> 00:19:30,316
Don’t ask how I knew.

332
00:19:31,289 --> 00:19:32,694
I don’t want to waste time.

333
00:19:33,250 --> 00:19:36,267
Last night, you were so mad at him.

334
00:19:36,267 --> 00:19:38,617
When did you clear things up?

335
00:19:39,406 --> 00:19:42,459
Who begged the other for forgiveness? Tell me.

336
00:19:43,259 --> 00:19:44,065
Begged?

337
00:19:44,735 --> 00:19:46,187
There was no begging.

338
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:50,445
I just ran into him and he followed me.

339
00:19:51,478 --> 00:19:54,967
You ran into him at dawn?

340
00:19:54,967 --> 00:19:56,428
That’s not a coincidence.

341
00:19:56,571 --> 00:19:59,257
That’s destiny.

342
00:19:59,376 --> 00:20:02,757
I came all the way here. Now tell me the truth.

343
00:20:03,711 --> 00:20:05,899
You like Moo, don’t you?

344
00:20:06,713 --> 00:20:07,627
No, I don’t.

345
00:20:07,885 --> 00:20:08,794
No?

346
00:20:09,648 --> 00:20:11,334
But you brought him food.

347
00:20:11,691 --> 00:20:12,883
You care for him.

348
00:20:13,042 --> 00:20:14,323
Why do you say you don’t have feelings for him?

349
00:20:15,097 --> 00:20:16,657
It’s really worrying.

350
00:20:16,955 --> 00:20:19,407
He didn’t come down to eat because he fell asleep in the classroom.

351
00:20:20,042 --> 00:20:23,376
The reason he fell asleep was because he went to the market with me at 3 a.m.

352
00:20:23,694 --> 00:20:27,104
He should be spending time getting to know his friends, not me.

353
00:20:28,014 --> 00:20:29,178
You’re serious.

354
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,461
Why don’t you talk to him then?

355
00:20:34,295 --> 00:20:34,910
I did.

356
00:20:35,625 --> 00:20:38,138
I talked and told him off, but he wouldn’t budge.

357
00:20:39,330 --> 00:20:41,876
If talking doesn’t work,

358
00:20:43,553 --> 00:20:45,195
you must use action.

359
00:21:11,547 --> 00:21:12,352
What’s wrong, Tae?

360
00:21:12,352 --> 00:21:12,988
Yos.

361
00:21:18,191 --> 00:21:20,215
I sucked at those moves just now.

362
00:21:35,129 --> 00:21:35,947
Come on.

363
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:37,607
Be patient.

364
00:21:37,766 --> 00:21:38,521
No need to rush.

365
00:21:39,097 --> 00:21:40,411
Go slowly with me.

366
00:21:43,607 --> 00:21:45,150
Can you teach me how to do those moves?

367
00:21:46,342 --> 00:21:46,842
Please?

368
00:21:49,674 --> 00:21:50,344
Sure.

369
00:21:50,721 --> 00:21:51,733
I’ll teach you those moves.

370
00:21:53,706 --> 00:21:54,278
Come on.

371
00:21:55,569 --> 00:21:56,878
Go slowly with me.

372
00:21:56,977 --> 00:21:57,477
Okay.

373
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:13,254
Hey!

374
00:22:13,492 --> 00:22:14,386
I can do those moves now!

375
00:22:14,743 --> 00:22:15,811
Thank you so much!

376
00:22:16,091 --> 00:22:17,972
You’re the only one who can help me with everything.

377
00:22:20,179 --> 00:22:21,544
Tae, stop it!

378
00:22:21,544 --> 00:22:22,478
You’re messing up my hair.

379
00:22:23,200 --> 00:22:23,964
You’re always touching it.

380
00:22:23,964 --> 00:22:24,714
What’s wrong with you?

381
00:22:26,740 --> 00:22:27,399
I can do those moves now.

382
00:22:28,296 --> 00:22:30,296
[Mommy Kai Rice & Curry]

383
00:22:33,369 --> 00:22:34,120
Where should I put these?

384
00:22:34,636 --> 00:22:35,351
Right here.

385
00:22:35,351 --> 00:22:36,391
Over there is fine too.

386
00:22:41,091 --> 00:22:42,401
It’s heavy, isn’t it?

387
00:22:42,798 --> 00:22:44,105
I told you you didn’t have to help me.

388
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:45,846
If you can’t manage, go to sleep.

389
00:22:46,429 --> 00:22:47,185
I can manage.

390
00:22:52,071 --> 00:22:53,196
This hurts so much!

391
00:22:56,854 --> 00:22:58,655
I bet you’ll last 2 more days

392
00:22:59,071 --> 00:23:00,851
before you get tired and not come back.

393
00:23:00,987 --> 00:23:01,921
I won’t get tired.

394
00:23:02,318 --> 00:23:04,059
Is there anything else I can help you with?

395
00:23:06,957 --> 00:23:08,739
Your next task is to wash all those dishes.

396
00:23:14,550 --> 00:23:15,597
That’s a lot.

397
00:23:15,815 --> 00:23:17,287
A rice and curry restaurant uses a lot of dishes.

398
00:23:17,545 --> 00:23:19,683
If it’s too much for you, feel free to leave.

399
00:23:21,927 --> 00:23:23,523
You must use action.

400
00:23:23,523 --> 00:23:26,345
Make him work hard.

401
00:23:26,532 --> 00:23:27,607
I don’t think that’s a good idea.

402
00:23:27,984 --> 00:23:30,279
You don’t have to make him work too hard.

403
00:23:30,279 --> 00:23:33,057
Just scare him away to make him distance himself.

404
00:23:33,426 --> 00:23:33,936
What do you say?

405
00:23:35,962 --> 00:23:36,709
I can do it.

406
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:38,988
It’s just washing the dishes. It’s not too much.

407
00:23:39,802 --> 00:23:40,523
It’s easy.

408
00:23:44,971 --> 00:23:45,628
Hey.

409
00:23:46,740 --> 00:23:49,211
Here’s a friendly warning.

410
00:23:49,211 --> 00:23:50,794
If you keep spending your time helping me

411
00:23:50,892 --> 00:23:53,251
instead of getting enough sleep, your academics are going to suffer.

412
00:23:53,335 --> 00:23:54,211
It’s okay.

413
00:23:54,211 --> 00:23:55,613
The hell it is.

414
00:23:55,613 --> 00:23:58,312
The other day, you fell asleep in the classroom and didn’t come down to eat.

415
00:23:58,460 --> 00:24:00,619
How many classes do you fall asleep in during the day?

416
00:24:03,648 --> 00:24:04,818
I’m adjusting.

417
00:24:05,195 --> 00:24:06,876
It’ll only take me a few more days to get used to it.

418
00:24:06,876 --> 00:24:07,546
I won’t be sleepy anymore.

419
00:24:07,546 --> 00:24:08,686
You’re just so stubborn.

420
00:24:09,004 --> 00:24:12,162
Not only should you focus on your studies instead of being here,

421
00:24:12,162 --> 00:24:13,156
you should also make some friends.

422
00:24:13,533 --> 00:24:15,345
You can’t be with me all the time.

423
00:24:15,345 --> 00:24:17,441
I can’t help with your studies.

424
00:24:17,689 --> 00:24:19,231
Your friends can.

425
00:24:23,650 --> 00:24:25,818
I’ll be with you this weekend.

426
00:24:25,818 --> 00:24:29,710
Then I’ll make friends on Monday, okay?

427
00:24:33,820 --> 00:24:36,301
Kang, is Lotus Stem Soup on the menu today?

428
00:24:36,301 --> 00:24:38,407
No. Do you want to eat it, Auntie Jit?

429
00:24:38,826 --> 00:24:41,303
My daughter does.

430
00:24:41,483 --> 00:24:42,773
It’s her pregnancy craving.

431
00:24:42,932 --> 00:24:46,464
I asked my husband to check the food stalls near the temple, but no one is selling it today.

432
00:24:46,464 --> 00:24:48,632
Do you know where we might find it?

433
00:24:49,725 --> 00:24:51,313
I have no idea.

434
00:24:51,313 --> 00:24:53,200
I’ll check the lotus pond.

435
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,017
There should be some lotus stems I can get.

436
00:24:55,136 --> 00:24:56,577
Then I’ll hurry back and make the soup for you.

437
00:24:56,577 --> 00:24:58,991
I don’t want to trouble you, but I can wait.

438
00:24:58,991 --> 00:24:59,839
Thank you.

439
00:25:00,416 --> 00:25:00,916
No worries.

440
00:25:07,608 --> 00:25:08,436
I’ll be back.

441
00:25:08,774 --> 00:25:09,782
Are you going to get lotus stems?

442
00:25:10,338 --> 00:25:11,873
It sounds fun. Can I go with you?

443
00:25:12,191 --> 00:25:14,676
Are you seriously going to follow me everywhere?

444
00:25:15,331 --> 00:25:15,839
Yes.

445
00:25:18,341 --> 00:25:19,196
Where are you going?

446
00:25:19,911 --> 00:25:20,781
Don’t follow me

447
00:25:21,091 --> 00:25:22,258
.Wait for me.

448
00:25:22,496 --> 00:25:23,339
I’m coming with you.

449
00:25:30,795 --> 00:25:32,113
You’ve been watching it so many times.

450
00:25:33,285 --> 00:25:35,239
It won’t be like the first time you watched it.

451
00:25:35,825 --> 00:25:36,942
Let me watch someone else’s clip.

452
00:25:38,303 --> 00:25:39,764
Hey, Yos. Look at Moo.

453
00:25:41,627 --> 00:25:43,066
He gets so many views.

454
00:25:46,876 --> 00:25:47,946
He’s a really good dancer.

455
00:25:48,171 --> 00:25:49,073
I saw it with my own eyes.

456
00:25:53,009 --> 00:25:54,030
I don’t think so.

457
00:25:54,867 --> 00:25:55,905
I think it’s because of his outfit.

458
00:25:56,763 --> 00:25:58,060
He’s not wearing a student uniform in the clip

459
00:25:58,688 --> 00:26:00,670
but we are, so we don’t look professional.

460
00:26:01,507 --> 00:26:03,552
I think we need grooming.

461
00:26:04,033 --> 00:26:05,421
Oh, grooming.

462
00:26:06,237 --> 00:26:06,910
What is it?

463
00:26:08,417 --> 00:26:11,732
Dressing up to look handsome like the Bangkok kids.

464
00:26:15,940 --> 00:26:16,657
Tae.

465
00:26:18,956 --> 00:26:21,668
So you stood me up to come here.

466
00:26:23,447 --> 00:26:25,583
Hey, Nomtan.

467
00:26:26,567 --> 00:26:27,253
I…

468
00:26:30,698 --> 00:26:32,371
Please calm down.

469
00:26:33,372 --> 00:26:34,586
I’m sorry.

470
00:26:34,774 --> 00:26:35,811
I didn’t mean it.

471
00:26:36,104 --> 00:26:41,265
Tell me honestly. You’re always with him because you two are dating, aren’t you?

472
00:26:43,121 --> 00:26:45,707
No, Nomtan.

473
00:26:46,032 --> 00:26:48,691
I saw you feeding each other earlier.

474
00:26:49,251 --> 00:26:51,167
Why did you get involved with me?

475
00:26:52,619 --> 00:26:53,466
Well,

476
00:26:58,364 --> 00:26:58,974
Payos,

477
00:27:00,439 --> 00:27:01,359
we don’t have to hide it anymore.

478
00:27:02,971 --> 00:27:04,008
It’s like what you saw.

479
00:27:07,274 --> 00:27:08,667
I’m dating Payos.

480
00:27:15,533 --> 00:27:16,405
Tae.

481
00:27:27,751 --> 00:27:29,015
That was close.

482
00:27:29,894 --> 00:27:30,763
Thank you.

483
00:27:43,030 --> 00:27:43,917
Whoa!

484
00:27:47,719 --> 00:27:48,964
You’re amazing, Kang.

485
00:27:49,780 --> 00:27:51,028
You know how to row a boat.

486
00:27:51,342 --> 00:27:56,184
I wouldn’t even know how to hold the paddles.

487
00:27:57,754 --> 00:27:58,503
It’s not hard.

488
00:27:58,796 --> 00:28:00,534
Everyone in the area can do it.

489
00:28:01,957 --> 00:28:03,004
This place is beautiful.

490
00:28:03,506 --> 00:28:07,482
People who don’t know we’re here to get lotus stems would think we’re on a date.

491
00:28:08,171 --> 00:28:09,722
(Damn. It really looks like it.)

492
00:28:12,590 --> 00:28:13,910
Let’s quickly get them and leave.

493
00:28:16,731 --> 00:28:17,811
Are you feeling shy?

494
00:28:18,783 --> 00:28:20,353
When you’re feeling shy, you always wipe your brow,

495
00:28:21,065 --> 00:28:21,652
don’t you?

496
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:23,407
Stop talking too much.

497
00:28:23,407 --> 00:28:24,605
Sit properly or you’ll fall off the boat.

498
00:28:29,902 --> 00:28:32,868
How do we know which ones to pick?

499
00:28:33,035 --> 00:28:34,053
Don’t get the stalks with leaves.

500
00:28:34,053 --> 00:28:35,396
Get the ones with only flowers.

501
00:28:35,522 --> 00:28:37,420
Find the ones that are easy to pluck.

502
00:28:38,171 --> 00:28:41,236
We need other colors than white. White lotus is for paying respect to the Buddha.

503
00:28:42,073 --> 00:28:43,521
Do you have an example?

504
00:28:46,746 --> 00:28:47,324
Sure.

This one here.

506
00:28:48,556 --> 00:28:49,643
Is it that easy to pluck it?

Yes.

508
00:28:50,666 --> 00:28:51,290
It’s easy.

Hey, I thought something bad happened to you.

520
00:29:38,432 --> 00:29:39,445
Are you worried about me?

I’m okay. I’m right here.

522

Why are you worried about me? Do you feel something for me?

523

Are you that worried about me?

Stop it.

It’s clean now.

Have you washed yours?

531
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:29,805
Not yet.

532

Let me help.

No need.

I can do it myself.

Don’t be stubborn.

Sit down.

537
00:30:40,375 --> 00:30:41,001
Give me the water.

538
00:30:48,395 --> 00:30:51,567
Wash it again when you get home so it’s really clean.

Are you feeling shy with me?

No, I’m not.

542
00:31:33,067 --> 00:31:34,380
Why are you sitting so close to me?

543
00:31:35,887 --> 00:31:38,804
Just checking if you still have anything on your face.

I never got to see something so beautiful

I’m not worried about you.

I just don’t want you to die before paying off your debt.

But I’m willing to forgive you all your debt

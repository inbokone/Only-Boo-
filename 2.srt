4
00:00:18,001 --> 00:00:19,431
He’s my new tenant.

5
00:00:19,431 --> 00:00:20,434
He’s from Bangkok.

6
00:00:20,434 --> 00:00:21,612
His mom just dropped him off this morning.

7
00:00:21,904 --> 00:00:23,240
She sent him here to discipline him.

8
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:25,703
You gave me the toothbrush,

9
00:00:25,703 --> 00:00:27,404
took me to the bicycle shop,

10
00:00:27,404 --> 00:00:28,560
fixed my bike,

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,627
dressed my wound,

12
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:31,193
and gave me food.

13
00:00:32,419 --> 00:00:33,520
Thank you.

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:34,490
Bad-Mouth-Kind-Heart Bro.

15
00:00:35,564 --> 00:00:37,040
You must be new.

16
00:00:37,206 --> 00:00:38,935
That’s why you don’t know who we are.

17
00:00:39,066 --> 00:00:42,000
Unexpected changes can happen all the time.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,679
You have to find happiness in change.

19
00:00:56,424 --> 00:00:57,287
Hey.

20
00:00:57,776 --> 00:00:58,804
You sell rice and curry here too?

21
00:00:58,804 --> 00:00:59,567
Hey.

22
00:00:59,567 --> 00:01:00,307
You again?

23
00:01:00,442 --> 00:01:01,673
Hi, Bad-Mouth-Kind-Heart Bro.

24
00:01:01,673 --> 00:01:02,916
That’s not my name.

25
00:01:02,916 --> 00:01:03,835
What’s your name then?

26
00:01:03,835 --> 00:01:04,800
You haven’t told me.

27
00:01:08,378 --> 00:01:09,497
Who’s even called Stir-Fried Clams?

28
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:10,761
Kang.

29
00:01:10,761 --> 00:01:12,014
My name is Kang.

30
00:01:12,123 --> 00:01:12,809
Kang.

31
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:14,919
I’ll memorize your name by heart.

32
00:02:35,061 --> 00:02:39,775
EP 2: THE KIND ONE

33
00:02:40,946 --> 00:02:41,677
What do you want?

34
00:02:41,677 --> 00:02:42,640
If you’re not going to eat, move.

35
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:43,707
You’re blocking other people.

36
00:02:45,081 --> 00:02:46,185
Well…

37
00:02:46,615 --> 00:02:47,801
This is all the money I have

38
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:49,429
for the whole month.

39
00:02:49,561 --> 00:02:50,100
Fine.

40
00:02:50,100 --> 00:02:51,018
You can pay me later.

41
00:02:51,018 --> 00:02:52,212
I’ll put it on your tab as usual.

42
00:02:52,212 --> 00:02:53,302
Thank you.

43
00:02:54,702 --> 00:02:59,281
Anyway, I know you’re not actually charging me 2-4 million.

44
00:02:59,678 --> 00:03:01,678
How about I help you work in exchange for food?

45
00:03:01,678 --> 00:03:02,752
I can do everything.

46
00:03:02,971 --> 00:03:06,000
I can get food for customers, sell, or wash dishes. Anything.

47
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:07,758
Let’s talk about that later.

48
00:03:07,849 --> 00:03:09,040
Now hurry up and order.

49
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:10,498
Many other people are waiting.

50
00:03:13,383 --> 00:03:15,220
Can I have this one?

51
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:15,881
Just one.

52
00:03:21,726 --> 00:03:22,993
Hey, I only want one.

53
00:03:23,748 --> 00:03:25,640
Just eat and don’t complain.

54
00:03:25,640 --> 00:03:27,218
Only one is not enough.

55
00:03:27,218 --> 00:03:29,405
Eating a big breakfast will make you smart.

56
00:03:31,045 --> 00:03:31,935
Remember that.

57
00:03:31,935 --> 00:03:32,665
Here you go.

58
00:03:33,979 --> 00:03:34,703
Thank you.

59
00:03:40,702 --> 00:03:41,788
What can I get you?

60
00:03:56,601 --> 00:03:57,296
Hey!

61
00:03:58,816 --> 00:04:00,447
You stole my spot again?

62
00:04:02,673 --> 00:04:03,387
Where?

63
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:06,657
You’re sitting in my spot.

64
00:04:08,969 --> 00:04:10,318
That’s how I reserved the table.

65
00:04:11,156 --> 00:04:12,939
The bottle lid was to reserve the table?

66
00:04:12,939 --> 00:04:13,687
I thought it was trash.

67
00:04:13,687 --> 00:04:14,187
Hey.

68
00:04:14,187 --> 00:04:15,472
Are you trying to get on our nerves?

69
00:04:15,685 --> 00:04:16,648
Are you trying to get on our nerves?

70
00:04:16,648 --> 00:04:18,160
Tae, calm down.

71
00:04:18,958 --> 00:04:19,912
He’s new.

72
00:04:20,156 --> 00:04:21,261
He’s clueless.

73
00:04:25,332 --> 00:04:26,471
Now you know.

74
00:04:26,963 --> 00:04:28,326
If you do it again,

75
00:04:29,029 --> 00:04:30,426
you’re trying to mess with us.

76
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:34,711
Leave.

77
00:05:03,256 --> 00:05:04,180
Oh, hey.

78
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:06,000
Why did you sit there?

79
00:05:07,413 --> 00:05:08,631
I didn’t know who to sit with.

80
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:09,603
I don’t have friends.

81
00:05:11,013 --> 00:05:12,360
Be careful.

82
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:14,788
Those two are the school bullies.

83
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:16,360
Don’t get into trouble with them.

84
00:05:17,173 --> 00:05:19,173
I’ll tell you something.

85
00:05:20,818 --> 00:05:22,927
Last year during a lunch break,

86
00:05:23,098 --> 00:05:26,096
something happened to a 12-grader named Plu who was known as the alpha kid.

87
00:05:26,451 --> 00:05:29,414
No one dared to mess with or defy him.

88
00:05:29,523 --> 00:05:30,872
Everyone could only join him

89
00:05:31,299 --> 00:05:33,299
and give way to him

90
00:05:33,499 --> 00:05:34,766
except…

91
00:05:34,766 --> 00:05:35,834
Who’s Potae?

92
00:05:37,164 --> 00:05:37,981
What’s the matter?

93
00:05:40,601 --> 00:05:44,000
You’re the one who broke my little sister Ploysai’s heart, right?

94
00:05:47,026 --> 00:05:48,483
You’re dead.

95
00:05:55,318 --> 00:05:56,393
The next morning,

96
00:05:57,615 --> 00:05:59,844
Plu was finished and he left the school.

97
00:06:00,333 --> 00:06:03,506
After that, no one dared mess with those two again.

98
00:06:05,243 --> 00:06:06,981
I didn’t want to mess with them.

99
00:06:06,981 --> 00:06:08,278
That’s why I walked away.

100
00:06:08,468 --> 00:06:10,646
Anyway, thank you for warning me.

101
00:06:15,881 --> 00:06:16,491
Wait.

102
00:06:34,597 --> 00:06:35,471
What?

103
00:06:38,606 --> 00:06:39,534
It was falling off.

104
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:15,324
[Matthayom 6/1]

105
00:07:20,048 --> 00:07:21,286
Oh god.

106
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:23,126
I’ll probably be late for homeroom.

107
00:07:25,542 --> 00:07:27,454
Hey, Ploypailin and Somsri!

108
00:07:27,454 --> 00:07:28,382
Get into the classroom.

109
00:07:28,382 --> 00:07:29,202
You’re late.

110
00:07:31,882 --> 00:07:32,508
Hi.

111
00:07:32,780 --> 00:07:33,409
Hi.

112
00:07:34,413 --> 00:07:37,754
Oh, you're Mok Diloksakulkan, right?

113
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:38,748
Yes, I am.

114
00:07:39,752 --> 00:07:40,512
What are you doing?

115
00:07:41,028 --> 00:07:42,367
I’m on my way to the classroom.

116
00:07:42,503 --> 00:07:43,073
Let’s go.

117
00:07:43,073 --> 00:07:44,192
- Come on. Follow me.
- Okay.

118
00:07:48,378 --> 00:07:48,941
Oh.

119
00:07:48,941 --> 00:07:49,441
Yes?

120
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:51,382
Let me tell your friends first.

121
00:07:51,626 --> 00:07:52,429
Wait here.

122
00:07:52,429 --> 00:07:53,355
Okay.

123
00:07:53,355 --> 00:07:54,523
Once I call you, you can come in.

124
00:07:54,731 --> 00:07:55,245
Okay.

125
00:07:55,245 --> 00:07:57,708
Also, don’t forget to take off your shoes, okay?

126
00:07:57,963 --> 00:07:58,850
Okay.

127
00:08:01,777 --> 00:08:05,759
Having fun chatting on the first day of your second semester?

128
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:08,720
Okay, you’re all seated.

129
00:08:08,924 --> 00:08:10,218
Today is a good day.

130
00:08:10,566 --> 00:08:12,702
We’re going to have a new friend.

131
00:08:13,598 --> 00:08:14,336
Come on in.

132
00:08:16,317 --> 00:08:17,720
Give him a big hand.

133
00:08:20,432 --> 00:08:22,432
That must be the red hoodie guy from this morning.

134
00:08:22,432 --> 00:08:23,271
Yeah, it’s him.

135
00:08:23,271 --> 00:08:24,687
I can’t believe he’s in this class.

136
00:08:24,932 --> 00:08:26,932
Be nice to your friend.

137
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:28,360
He just moved here from Bangkok.

138
00:08:28,663 --> 00:08:31,070
His name is Mok Diloksakulkan.

139
00:08:32,043 --> 00:08:34,043
I’d appreciate your advice. You can call me Moo.

140
00:08:40,811 --> 00:08:41,621
Don’t go yet.

141
00:08:41,621 --> 00:08:42,485
I’m not finished.

142
00:08:43,612 --> 00:08:46,280
If you know who Moo’s mom is, you’ll be chilled to the bone.

143
00:08:46,647 --> 00:08:48,538
She’s not a fan or an AC. Don’t make that joke.

144
00:08:49,849 --> 00:08:51,849
His mom is an alumna of this school

145
00:08:51,904 --> 00:08:56,510
and is now a producer at a music company with many famous songs.

146
00:08:56,510 --> 00:08:57,683
Don’t say a loudspeaker gets their songs heard.

147
00:08:57,849 --> 00:08:59,089
That joke is also outdated.

148
00:08:59,089 --> 00:09:01,412
This music company really has many famous songs.

149
00:09:02,018 --> 00:09:03,760
CP Entertainment.

150
00:09:04,298 --> 00:09:05,158
Have you heard of it?

151
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:18,379
If any of you want to be a singer, you can talk to Moo.

152
00:09:18,379 --> 00:09:19,092
Teacher.

153
00:09:19,092 --> 00:09:19,773
Right?

154
00:09:20,553 --> 00:09:21,316
Yes.

155
00:09:21,316 --> 00:09:22,933
Are you alright? You look a bit sheepish.

156
00:09:23,852 --> 00:09:26,015
Keep your spirits up. It’s your first morning here.

157
00:09:26,015 --> 00:09:26,883
Go to your seat.

158
00:09:31,042 --> 00:09:33,558
Alright, Let me do an attendance check.

159
00:09:35,349 --> 00:09:40,769
(Shit. They’re already giving me side-eyes on my first day.)

160
00:09:46,281 --> 00:09:48,000
Is this a lunch break?

161
00:10:14,526 --> 00:10:15,760
Hey, you!

162
00:10:19,313 --> 00:10:20,257
(Me?)

163
00:10:20,257 --> 00:10:21,520
Yes, you!

164
00:10:29,106 --> 00:10:30,129
Excuse me.

165
00:10:31,885 --> 00:10:33,523
Move!

166
00:10:33,659 --> 00:10:34,889
Let’s go!

167
00:10:48,444 --> 00:10:49,227
Shit, Kang!

168
00:10:49,471 --> 00:10:50,688
Why are you cursing at me?

169
00:10:50,688 --> 00:10:51,263
I’m not.

170
00:10:51,263 --> 00:10:51,975
I’m just shocked.

171
00:10:51,975 --> 00:10:52,571
What have you done?

172
00:10:52,571 --> 00:10:53,866
Why do you look like you’re running from ghosts?

173
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,291
Ghosts would be less scary.

174
00:10:55,400 --> 00:10:56,525
I’m suddenly getting picked on.

175
00:10:56,525 --> 00:10:57,672
Whose toes did you step on this time?

176
00:10:57,672 --> 00:10:58,455
I did not.

177
00:10:58,455 --> 00:11:01,160
I guess they’re picking on me because I’m new.

178
00:11:01,160 --> 00:11:02,013
Luckily, I ran away first.

179
00:11:02,013 --> 00:11:02,640
I have to go.

180
00:11:03,131 --> 00:11:03,892
Moo is over there!

181
00:11:03,892 --> 00:11:05,131
Get him!

182
00:11:05,241 --> 00:11:05,834
Hey!

183
00:11:07,241 --> 00:11:08,648
Don’t fight in school!

184
00:11:08,648 --> 00:11:09,148
Quiet!

185
00:11:09,148 --> 00:11:10,256
- Let go of me!
- Go back to selling rice and curry.

186
00:11:10,256 --> 00:11:11,916
Let go of me!

187
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:13,824
Kang!

188
00:11:13,881 --> 00:11:15,772
Help me, Kang!

189
00:11:17,178 --> 00:11:18,000
Let go!

190
00:11:18,163 --> 00:11:19,341
Let go! What are you doing to me?

191
00:11:20,513 --> 00:11:21,325
Let go of me!

192
00:11:21,325 --> 00:11:22,513
Let go of Moo!

193
00:11:22,513 --> 00:11:23,327
What did he do to you?

194
00:11:24,726 --> 00:11:25,766
What are you guys doing?

195
00:11:25,766 --> 00:11:26,726
Ganging up on him?

196
00:11:30,892 --> 00:11:31,821
Let go of me!

197
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:35,791
Don’t come any closer!

198
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:37,336
Don’t come any closer!

199
00:11:38,232 --> 00:11:41,440
Don’t come any closer!

200
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,258
Don’t!

211
00:12:40,249 --> 00:12:41,567
Looks like everything is fine now.

212
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:42,682
I’m leaving.

213
00:12:44,256 --> 00:12:44,927
Kang.

214
00:12:51,998 --> 00:12:53,159
We’re sorry, Master,

215
00:12:53,159 --> 00:12:55,464
for being rude to you this morning.

216
00:12:55,464 --> 00:12:57,243
We just found out who your mom is.

217
00:12:58,555 --> 00:13:01,520
We apologize for not knowing anything outside Nakhon Pathom.

218
00:13:03,404 --> 00:13:05,404
We were ignorant.

219
00:13:07,513 --> 00:13:12,000
Does our joke make you feel any better, Master?

220
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,204
If not, please feel free to blame Tae.

221
00:13:15,204 --> 00:13:15,810
I have nothing to do with it.

222
00:13:18,935 --> 00:13:19,856
Well, you can blame me.

223
00:13:20,779 --> 00:13:25,920
Honestly, I’m still confused why you guys danced for me.

224
00:13:27,656 --> 00:13:30,000
We’d like some help, Master.

225
00:13:30,332 --> 00:13:33,360
Could you show our dance clip to your mom?

226
00:13:33,803 --> 00:13:36,916
We happen to be a dance group

227
00:13:37,050 --> 00:13:40,640
and your mom happens to be a producer

228
00:13:40,920 --> 00:13:45,960
so we’d really appreciate kindness and support from your mom.

229
00:13:46,890 --> 00:13:49,053
What a perfect coincidence, Master

230
00:13:49,292 --> 00:13:52,161
Could you ask your mom to consider helping us?

231
00:13:53,368 --> 00:13:56,560
So, you guys dragged me here

232
00:13:56,646 --> 00:13:57,686
to make me watch you dance?

233
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:00,040
Yes.

234
00:14:01,435 --> 00:14:03,435
I thought I was being threatened.

235
00:14:03,477 --> 00:14:07,486
I thought you two were going to punch my face and break my arms like you did to that 12-grader.

236
00:14:09,405 --> 00:14:10,916
Here’s the true story, Master.

237
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:15,640
Hey, calm down, bro!

238
00:14:16,272 --> 00:14:18,000
Don’t try to make an excuse.

239
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:18,838
Hey, bro.

240
00:14:18,838 --> 00:14:20,279
You two are going to get it.

241
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:21,385
Calm down, bro.

242
00:14:21,385 --> 00:14:22,513
Let’s talk nicely.

243
00:14:22,513 --> 00:14:23,674
Yes!

244
00:14:25,887 --> 00:14:27,127
Hey, come on!

245
00:14:27,679 --> 00:14:28,865
Come at me!

246
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:34,430
More!

247
00:14:38,512 --> 00:14:39,682
Oh, shit!

248
00:14:40,251 --> 00:14:41,170
You’re going to get it!

249
00:14:51,051 --> 00:14:52,186
Shit!

250
00:14:55,498 --> 00:14:56,657
Is he dead?

251
00:14:58,286 --> 00:15:00,564
After that, Plu’s dad took him out of this school.

252
00:15:00,863 --> 00:15:04,454
It was an accident that allowed us to pretend to be powerful.

253
00:15:04,861 --> 00:15:06,963
Who wouldn’t take that golden opportunity?

254
00:15:08,796 --> 00:15:13,945
So there was no arm or leg breaking, right?

255
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:15,807
Of course not, Master.

256
00:15:16,372 --> 00:15:18,209
We’re not thugs.

257
00:15:18,601 --> 00:15:22,240
Like we said, we prefer dancing and singing.

258
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:24,783
We’ve been practicing for a year to audition.

259
00:15:24,783 --> 00:15:26,519
We go to every audition there is.

260
00:15:26,519 --> 00:15:28,789
We want a lot of people to see our talent.

261
00:15:28,967 --> 00:15:29,900
Really?

262
00:15:30,443 --> 00:15:31,510
Me too.

263
00:15:31,510 --> 00:15:32,177
Really?

264
00:15:32,177 --> 00:15:33,575
Would you like to dance with us then?

265
00:15:33,575 --> 00:15:34,225
Can I?

266
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:36,904
Where do you guys normally dance?

267
00:15:36,904 --> 00:15:38,386
I’ve wanted someone to help with my dance moves for a few days now.

268
00:15:38,661 --> 00:15:39,920
Tae can help you with that, Master.

269
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:40,918
That’s amazing, Master.

270
00:15:40,918 --> 00:15:41,645
Let me take you there.

271
00:15:50,243 --> 00:15:51,343
It’s just one semester.

272
00:15:51,343 --> 00:15:54,930
Go and study there so there’s no entertainment to distract you.

273
00:15:55,117 --> 00:15:59,120
Just focus on doing well in school and passing the university admission exam.

274
00:15:59,120 --> 00:16:00,608
That’s enough.

275
00:16:00,608 --> 00:16:01,351
End of story.

276
00:16:02,544 --> 00:16:03,275
Mom.

277
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:05,412
You won’t change your mind no matter what I say, right?

278
00:16:09,098 --> 00:16:11,800
If your dream is really important to you,

279
00:16:11,800 --> 00:16:14,037
you must do what I ask.

280
00:16:14,485 --> 00:16:19,525
Consider this one of the tests you have to pass to reach your dream.

281
00:16:21,616 --> 00:16:22,660
don’t want to go anymore.

282
00:16:24,153 --> 00:16:25,109
What?

283
00:16:25,109 --> 00:16:25,943
Why not, Master?

284
00:16:28,711 --> 00:16:29,797
I have my reasons.

285
00:16:29,797 --> 00:16:30,711
I’m sorry.

286
00:16:34,203 --> 00:16:35,089
Master!

287
00:16:35,252 --> 00:16:36,149

(I better leave before my arms and legs start moving on their own.)

299
00:17:32,435 --> 00:17:33,302
Everything is closed already?

300
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,036
Why does the canteen close so early?

301
00:17:38,138 --> 00:17:39,007
I’m hungry.

302
00:17:52,869 --> 00:17:54,457
What? The water is not running either?

303
00:17:55,192 --> 00:17:56,427
I can’t even get water to drink?

304
00:18:12,050 --> 00:18:12,815
Whoa.

305
00:18:24,833 --> 00:18:25,845
What are you doing?

306
00:18:29,390 --> 00:18:30,012
Kang.

307
00:18:38,385 --> 00:18:40,920
If I hadn’t come back to get eggs, you would’ve choked on water.

308
00:18:41,424 --> 00:18:42,790
Here’s a towel.

309
00:18:43,613 --> 00:18:44,498
Thank you.

310
00:18:49,530 --> 00:18:51,301
Hey, is this a table cleaning cloth?

311
00:18:51,301 --> 00:18:52,538
It’s clean. You can use it.

312
00:18:52,538 --> 00:18:53,939
But you look very suspicious.

313
00:18:56,885 --> 00:18:58,542
Why don’t you wipe your face with it first if it’s really clean?

314
00:18:58,542 --> 00:19:00,107
It really is clean. You can use it.

315
00:19:00,337 --> 00:19:01,226
Let’s wipe your face first.

316
00:19:01,226 --> 00:19:01,946
Moo, don’t.

317
00:19:01,946 --> 00:19:02,446
Come on.

318
00:19:02,812 --> 00:19:03,477
Hey.

319
00:19:03,477 --> 00:19:03,977
Let’s wipe your face first.

320
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:04,995
Hey.

321
00:19:04,995 --> 00:19:06,205
Moo! Don’t!

322
00:19:06,205 --> 00:19:07,318
You’re going to break them.

323
00:19:07,707 --> 00:19:08,283
What?

324
00:19:08,474 --> 00:19:09,525
The eggs.

325
00:19:09,777 --> 00:19:10,726
Don’t break them.

326
00:19:11,900 --> 00:19:12,637
Fine.

327
00:19:13,072 --> 00:19:13,969
It’s a table cleaning cloth.

328
00:19:14,267 --> 00:19:15,003
I knew it.

329
00:19:15,643 --> 00:19:17,159
You’re pranking me again.

330
00:19:17,321 --> 00:19:18,461
You’re so tricky.

331
00:19:38,018 --> 00:19:38,547
I’m dry now.

332
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:42,747
You’re dry but I’m wet.

333
00:19:43,662 --> 00:19:45,271
You were making me wipe my face with a table cleaning cloth.

334
00:19:46,049 --> 00:19:46,774
I’m hungry.

335
00:19:46,980 --> 00:19:49,120
They only sell food here in the morning and at lunchtime.

336
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:50,240
They all close in the evening.

337
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:51,502
There’s nothing for you to eat.

338
00:19:54,384 --> 00:19:55,796
Where do people get food in the evening?

339
00:19:56,002 --> 00:19:57,244

No wonder you can sell food every day.

00:27:15,294 --> 00:27:15,877
My hands!

509
00:27:16,905 --> 00:27:17,575
Will you stop now?

510
00:27:21,692 --> 00:27:22,504
What’s wrong with you?

511
00:27:22,504 --> 00:27:23,200
Hey.

512
00:27:24,320 --> 00:27:25,480
My shoulders started moving.

513
00:27:26,786 --> 00:27:27,880
Hold my shoulders.

514
00:27:28,429 --> 00:27:29,129
Are you okay now?

515
00:27:34,208 --> 00:27:34,781
My waist started moving.

516
00:27:34,781 --> 00:27:35,720
Can you hold my waist?

517
00:27:36,040 --> 00:27:36,980
Can you hold my waist?

518
00:27:37,320 --> 00:27:38,084
Hold my waist.

519
00:27:43,597 --> 00:27:45,138
Hey, it still won’t stop.

520
00:27:45,138 --> 00:27:47,320
I’m waving.

521
00:27:50,237 --> 00:27:51,793
Hug me.

522
00:27:51,793 --> 00:27:52,831
Do I have to?

523
00:27:52,831 --> 00:27:53,681
Hug me.

524
00:27:53,681 --> 00:27:54,489
I’m waving.

525
00:27:57,505 --> 00:27:58,260
Hug me.

526
00:27:58,260 --> 00:27:59,208
Quickly.

527
00:28:16,971 --> 00:28:18,045
Let’s call it a day.

528
00:28:18,388 --> 00:28:19,040
I’m tired.

529
00:28:20,947 --> 00:28:21,537
I feel faint.

530
00:28:22,653 --> 00:28:23,265
Not yet.

531
00:28:23,952 --> 00:28:25,308
My moves are still awkward.

532
00:28:25,623 --> 00:28:26,402
I need to practice more

533
00:28:26,402 --> 00:28:28,696
so when Master Moo’s mom sees me, I can catch her eyes.

534
00:28:29,244 --> 00:28:31,600
Before you can catch her eyes, sweat will get into your eyes.

535
00:28:31,926 --> 00:28:33,067
Take a rest and drink some water.

536
00:28:33,153 --> 00:28:33,840
Alright.

537
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:34,573
28.

538
00:28:39,832 --> 00:28:40,584
Did it stop?

539
00:28:43,751 --> 00:28:44,266
Yes.

540
00:28:48,501 --> 00:28:49,398
What’s wrong with you?

541
00:28:50,192 --> 00:28:51,295
Did you hear the music?

542
00:28:51,986 --> 00:28:52,509
Yes.

543
00:28:53,132 --> 00:28:56,320
Whenever I hear music, I dance and do body waves.

544
00:28:56,570 --> 00:28:58,360
My heart wants to dance but my brain tells me to stop.

545
00:28:58,720 --> 00:29:01,300
My mom gave me an ultimatum to study hard and not get distracted.

546
00:29:03,127 --> 00:29:06,350
I don’t want to hurt her feelings but it’s hard to control my body.

547
00:29:06,350 --> 00:29:07,195
That’s why I needed your help.

548
00:29:07,681 --> 00:29:09,617
But you were dancing in exchange for food the other day.

549
00:29:09,847 --> 00:29:10,587
It’s not the same.

550
00:29:10,587 --> 00:29:11,600
That’s just for fun.

551
00:29:11,757 --> 00:29:12,769
I think you’re crazy.

552
00:29:12,984 --> 00:29:17,000
Haven’t you ever loved and wanted to do something so much

553
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:18,924
but couldn’t because you didn’t want to hurt the people you love?

554
00:29:24,333 --> 00:29:25,141
I have.

555
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:28,566
Then why did you criticize me?

556
00:29:29,973 --> 00:29:30,609
I’m sorry.

557
00:29:32,498 --> 00:29:34,040
I guess I misunderstood you.

558
00:29:35,471 --> 00:29:40,360
But we can work towards dreams and reality at the same time, right?

559
00:29:42,060 --> 00:29:43,296
You don’t have to give up anything.

560
00:29:45,314 --> 00:29:47,044
Do you think I can do that?

561
00:29:53,876 --> 00:29:54,376
Yeah.

562
00:29:56,200 --> 00:29:59,718
No one can stop your dream except yourself.

563
00:30:03,586 --> 00:30:04,395
Kang,

564
00:30:05,447 --> 00:30:06,440
don’t do this.

565
00:30:08,345 --> 00:30:08,845
What?

566
00:30:10,713 --> 00:30:11,856
When you do that,

567
00:30:12,929 --> 00:30:13,819
you look cool.

568
00:30:14,205 --> 00:30:15,719
You’ll melt my heart.

569
00:30:19,529 --> 00:30:21,237
If you want to dance, dance.

570
00:30:22,267 --> 00:30:23,664
I won’t tell your mom.

571
00:30:52,252 --> 00:30:53,107
It’s hot.

572
00:30:53,794 --> 00:30:54,840
Yeah, it’s hot.

573
00:30:54,840 --> 00:30:55,758
Are you hot too?

574
00:30:56,101 --> 00:30:57,000
Let me help.

575
00:30:57,259 --> 00:30:58,504
Hey, what are you doing?

576
00:30:58,504 --> 00:30:59,889
No, I don’t want to get wet! Don’t!

577
00:31:02,894 --> 00:31:04,102
Oh, I’m sorry.

578
00:31:04,102 --> 00:31:05,293
- It got into my eyes.
- I’m sorry.

579
00:31:06,259 --> 00:31:07,163
Are you alright?

580
00:31:07,528 --> 00:31:09,040
It got into my eyes, Tae.

581
00:31:09,040 --> 00:31:09,671
Where?

582
00:31:09,671 --> 00:31:10,671
Let me see.

583
00:31:11,444 --> 00:31:12,754
Let me wipe it off.

584
00:31:13,076 --> 00:31:14,303
Your eyes are not red.

585
00:31:14,303 --> 00:31:15,612
I’m sorry.

586
00:31:21,855 --> 00:31:22,681
Stop it.

587
00:31:23,855 --> 00:31:25,287
What the hell were you doing?

588
00:31:25,460 --> 00:31:26,215
I’m all wet.

589
00:31:27,331 --> 00:31:28,361
Let’s continue practicing.

590
00:31:44,278 --> 00:31:45,117
Shit!

591
00:31:45,868 --> 00:31:46,368
What?

592
00:31:46,883 --> 00:31:48,102
I have a date with Nomtan.

593
00:31:49,174 --> 00:31:50,016
See you later.

594
00:31:50,166 --> 00:31:50,981
I have to hurry.

595
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:54,040
What about your dance practice with me?

596
00:31:55,712 --> 00:31:57,085
Please stop by!

597
00:32:12,320 --> 00:32:13,655
Please stop by!

598
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:31,750
Here.

599
00:32:32,308 --> 00:32:34,745
You’re tired from dancing so I brought you this.

600
00:32:34,900 --> 00:32:35,854
It’ll make you feel refreshed.

601
00:32:37,700 --> 00:32:40,280
My heart is already refreshed that you brought it to me.

602
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:41,833
You talk too much.

603
00:32:48,746 --> 00:32:49,440
Here.

604
00:33:00,822 --> 00:33:02,243
I feel so refreshed drinking it.

605
00:33:02,329 --> 00:33:02,908
Try it.

606
00:33:03,912 --> 00:33:05,054
No, you drink it.

607
00:33:07,158 --> 00:33:08,016
Please try it.

608
00:33:23,538 --> 00:33:24,280
How was it?

609
00:33:25,675 --> 00:33:26,590
Refreshing?

610
00:33:33,814 --> 00:33:35,428
Your dance was great today.

611
00:33:36,744 --> 00:33:38,066
My food is almost sold out.

612
00:33:39,483 --> 00:33:42,199
Normally, I give what’s left away.

613
00:33:45,591 --> 00:33:46,591
Give it away?

614
00:33:47,149 --> 00:33:49,606
Why don’t you sell it at a cheap price to avoid losing money?

615
00:33:50,962 --> 00:33:54,529
I give whatever I can to make this world a better place.

616
00:33:57,867 --> 00:34:01,048
If there’s a contest for the most kindhearted person in the world,

617
00:34:01,442 --> 00:34:02,623
you’d win first prize.

618
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:04,480
You’re exaggerating.

619
00:34:05,898 --> 00:34:07,898
I just give away a bit of food.

620
00:34:08,977 --> 00:34:10,260
But you really are kind

621
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:14,127
compared to my mom who is so cruel.

622
00:34:14,280 --> 00:34:17,680
What kind of person sends her kid away to struggle?

623
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,704
She also said that if I get bad grades and fail to get into university,

624
00:34:21,704 --> 00:34:22,647
she won’t let me dance again.

625
00:34:24,296 --> 00:34:26,017
You’re the only one who let me dance.

626
00:34:29,931 --> 00:34:31,759
Why do you want to dance so much?

627
00:34:33,846 --> 00:34:35,503
I want to be a world-class artist.

628
00:34:38,315 --> 00:34:39,302
That ambitious?

629
00:34:40,053 --> 00:34:40,637
Yeah.

630
00:34:41,680 --> 00:34:45,483
Have you ever heard of the saying, “Everyone has their own Everest”?

631
00:34:46,577 --> 00:34:50,280
I know that dreams don’t come true easily

632
00:34:51,307 --> 00:34:57,193
so I’ll practice hard until I achieve my dream and get to debut.

633
00:34:57,807 --> 00:35:00,043
All of that is my Everest.

634
00:35:05,877 --> 00:35:07,877
What’s your Everest?

635
00:35:33,577 --> 00:35:34,541
Sorry.

636
00:35:36,194 --> 00:35:37,445
Are you okay?

637
00:35:39,341 --> 00:35:39,992
Huh?

638
00:35:40,228 --> 00:35:41,191
Are you okay?

639
00:35:41,191 --> 00:35:41,892
I am.

640
00:36:24,996 --> 00:36:25,704
Moo.

641
00:36:26,198 --> 00:36:26,794
Huh?

642
00:36:28,340 --> 00:36:29,036
We’ve arrived.

643
00:36:30,037 --> 00:36:30,960
We’re at your dorm now.

644
00:36:31,475 --> 00:36:32,745
Did I fall asleep?

645
00:36:33,417 --> 00:36:34,360
Yes.

646
00:36:34,897 --> 00:36:36,906
And you held me like this the whole way here?

647
00:36:38,495 --> 00:36:40,166
Did you drool on my shoulder? Check.

648
00:36:56,374 --> 00:36:57,372
I didn’t.

649
00:37:10,148 --> 00:37:11,206
It’s okay. I can do it myself.

650
00:37:11,206 --> 00:37:11,924
It’s okay.

651
00:37:19,958 --> 00:37:20,739
Thank you.

652
00:37:21,769 --> 00:37:23,755
You helped me for free so many times.

653
00:37:24,184 --> 00:37:25,106
Nothing is free.

654
00:37:25,364 --> 00:37:26,454
I’ve put it all on your tab.

655
00:37:26,905 --> 00:37:28,077
That’s fine

656
00:37:28,528 --> 00:37:29,835
but I have something for you

657
00:37:30,458 --> 00:37:33,010
so you’ll have something to do besides selling food.

658
00:37:35,414 --> 00:37:36,106
Here.

659
00:37:36,364 --> 00:37:37,299
You can borrow this.

660
00:37:37,299 --> 00:37:38,243
Free of charge.

661
00:37:39,917 --> 00:37:41,346
I said I don’t want it.

662
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:42,661
I don’t really use it.

663
00:37:42,780 --> 00:37:45,200
If you draw on it, you’ll get more use out of it than I do.

664
00:37:46,756 --> 00:37:47,824
I don’t want it.

665
00:37:48,017 --> 00:37:49,538
You’re not troubling me, Kang.

666
00:37:49,538 --> 00:37:52,720
If you try drawing on it, I guarantee you’ll forget paper.

667
00:37:52,892 --> 00:37:54,386
I said I don’t want it.

668
00:37:54,386 --> 00:37:56,123
Trust me. It’s good. I want to give it to you.

669
00:37:56,123 --> 00:37:56,880
I don’t want it.

670
00:37:57,009 --> 00:37:58,211
Can you please accept my kindness?

671
00:37:58,211 --> 00:37:59,649
Hey, I said I don’t want it!

672
00:38:00,216 --> 00:38:01,643
Do you understand what I say?

673
00:38:04,155 --> 00:38:06,510
And don’t bring up drawing again.

674
00:38:33,076 --> 00:38:34,879
You shouldn’t have scolded him like that.

675
00:38:35,437 --> 00:38:37,078
He doesn’t know your story.

676
00:38:37,905 --> 00:38:40,461
All the more reason he shouldn’t have talked about it.

677
00:38:41,427 --> 00:38:43,427
And I said no many times.

678
00:38:45,369 --> 00:38:46,114
Kang,

679
00:38:46,616 --> 00:38:49,002
you must stop being like this.

680
00:38:49,613 --> 00:38:51,326
You have to overcome it.

681
00:38:52,311 --> 00:38:53,682
No one blames you.

682
00:38:54,256 --> 00:38:56,558
You say that because you’re not me.

683
00:38:57,007 --> 00:38:58,870
And you said that to me again.

684
00:39:00,099 --> 00:39:01,543
I don’t know what else to say.

685
00:39:02,225 --> 00:39:05,940
Go and figure out by yourself if what you said was right

686
00:39:07,135 --> 00:39:11,396
but I believe your dad doesn’t want you to be like this.

687
00:39:33,713 --> 00:39:35,196
(Kang got angry for no reason.)

688
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:37,265
(He’s not my happiness while being here anymore.)

689
00:39:37,720 --> 00:39:40,123
(I won’t eat at his place anymore. I won’t bother him anymore.)

690
00:39:42,618 --> 00:39:43,442
(Here they come again.)

691
00:39:43,720 --> 00:39:46,559
(From now on, I’ll slap and crush them like how I’d slap a volleyball.)

692
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,640
[MOMMY KAI RICE & CURRY]

693
00:40:02,974 --> 00:40:03,804
I don’t want it.

694
00:40:04,109 --> 00:40:05,746
You’re not troubling me, Kang.

695
00:40:05,746 --> 00:40:08,770
If you try drawing on it, I guarantee you’ll forget paper.

696
00:40:09,001 --> 00:40:10,398
I said I don’t want it.

697
00:40:10,577 --> 00:40:11,872
Trust me. It’s good. I want to give it to you.

698
00:40:11,872 --> 00:40:12,755
I don’t want it.

699
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:14,389
Can you please accept my kindness?

700
00:40:14,389 --> 00:40:15,746
Hey, I said I don’t want it!

701
00:40:16,229 --> 00:40:17,709
Do you understand what I say?

702
00:40:20,360 --> 00:40:22,706
And don’t bring up drawing again.

703
00:40:50,819 --> 00:40:51,462
Hello, hun.

704
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:53,466
Yes,

705
00:40:54,399 --> 00:40:54,978
I’m on my way back.

706
00:40:55,720 --> 00:40:57,263
Don’t tell him yet.

707
00:40:57,550 --> 00:41:01,360
I want to see his face when he’s happy.

708
00:41:26,962 --> 00:41:28,531
(Was I too harsh on him?)

709
00:41:34,756 --> 00:41:36,594
(I wonder if Moo is still angry with me.)

710
00:41:37,685 --> 00:41:40,582
(It’s 3 a.m. now. I better wait until morning.)

711
00:41:59,828 --> 00:42:00,590
Moo?

712
00:42:02,421 --> 00:42:03,002
Kang.

713
00:42:03,659 --> 00:42:04,513
Where did you go?

714
00:42:05,969 --> 00:42:06,940
I’ve been waiting for you for a long time.

715
00:42:07,969 --> 00:42:09,106
Why have you been waiting?

716
00:42:13,013 --> 00:42:13,984
I want to apologize to you.

717
00:42:15,168 --> 00:42:17,256
I don’t know if I crossed any line

718
00:42:18,219 --> 00:42:19,534
but seeing how mad you were at me,

719
00:42:21,490 --> 00:42:23,559
I think you had your reasons.

720
00:42:24,833 --> 00:42:26,236
And I thought over what I did.

721
00:42:26,972 --> 00:42:28,151
It’s my fault.

722
00:42:28,966 --> 00:42:29,841
I’m sorry, Kang.

723
00:42:30,792 --> 00:42:31,522
It’s not your fault.

724
00:42:32,471 --> 00:42:34,720
I shouldn’t have taken my feelings out on you.

725
00:42:35,281 --> 00:42:35,842
Stop.

726
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,085
What did you do?

727
00:42:59,893 --> 00:43:00,709
It was just a mosquito.

728
00:43:01,596 --> 00:43:02,599
I did what you told me to.

729
00:43:03,048 --> 00:43:04,045
I shooed it away and it left.

730
00:43:07,366 --> 00:43:08,600
But I’m not a mosquito.

731
00:43:12,189 --> 00:43:15,127
No matter how much you shoo me away, I won’t leave.

732
00:43:40,755 --> 00:43:42,747
(After Kang and I made up,)

733
00:43:44,111 --> 00:43:45,785
(I follow him everywhere.)

734
00:43:46,431 --> 00:43:48,568
Here’s a friendly reminder.

735
00:43:48,835 --> 00:43:50,422
If you keep spending your time helping me

736
00:43:50,657 --> 00:43:53,052
instead of getting enough sleep, your academics are going to suffer.

737
00:43:53,052 --> 00:43:55,380
I sucked at those moves just now.

738
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:56,905
I’ll teach you how to dance.

739
00:43:56,905 --> 00:43:57,520
Come on.

740
00:43:57,765 --> 00:43:59,316
(That I…)

741
00:44:00,946 --> 00:44:02,680
Why didn’t you tell me you’re sick?

742
00:44:02,781 --> 00:44:04,112
(Not only am I physically sick,)

743
00:44:04,112 --> 00:44:06,067
Take off your shirt.
(but I’ve also started to feel lovesick.)

744
00:44:06,067 --> 00:44:07,168
(Oh, Moo!)

745
00:44:07,842 --> 00:44:08,920
You like Moo, don’t you?

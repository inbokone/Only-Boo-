You came to see me so early in the morning. Did you miss me?

Early in the morning?

Shall we go in first?

147
00:10:17,017 --> 00:10:18,177

So what?

153

176

Yay!

177
00:11:47,309 --> 00:11:50,862
Do you know that Nakhon Pathom has many tourist attractions?

178
00:11:50,862 --> 00:11:51,550
You can pay respect to the Buddha.

179
00:11:51,923 --> 00:11:52,734
Visit dog cafes.

180
00:11:53,375 --> 00:11:54,641
Visit cat cafes.

181
00:11:54,851 --> 00:11:56,507
Try civet coffee and black ivory coffee.

182
00:11:56,730 --> 00:11:58,703
Do you guys like coffee?

183
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:00,000
No.

184
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:02,383
I don’t like that you’re wasting my time.

185
00:12:03,469 --> 00:12:07,512
Do you guys want to be singers or travel show hosts?

186
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:10,309
You applied as a team of three.

187
00:12:10,309 --> 00:12:11,399
Where’s the other one?

188
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:12,843
Are you two going to audition without him?

189
00:12:12,843 --> 00:12:14,242
What do we do? He’s not here yet.

190
00:12:14,242 --> 00:12:15,054
Shall we just do it?

191
00:12:15,054 --> 00:12:16,777
If you’re not serious about this,

192
00:12:16,777 --> 00:12:18,358
this is not for you.

193
00:12:21,255 --> 00:12:23,941
I’m going to give you 10 seconds

194
00:12:23,941 --> 00:12:25,985
to decide

195
00:12:25,985 --> 00:12:27,634
whether you want to wait for your friend

196
00:12:28,275 --> 00:12:29,745
or audition with just the two of you.

197
00:12:30,135 --> 00:12:33,257
But if you wait for your friend and he doesn’t make it in time,

198
00:12:33,536 --> 00:12:34,780
you’re disqualified.

199
00:12:41,465 --> 00:12:42,358
Moo.

200
00:12:42,358 --> 00:12:42,977
Huh?

201
00:12:42,977 --> 00:12:44,058
Go get ‘em.

202
00:12:44,058 --> 00:12:45,109
I will.

203
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,171
Can you take this?

204
00:12:48,171 --> 00:12:48,720
I have to go.

205
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:49,550
Hurry.

206
00:12:52,697 --> 00:12:53,344
Kang.

207
00:12:54,207 --> 00:12:55,759
Give me a hug. I need some encouragement.

208
00:13:00,967 --> 00:13:01,920
I’m going now.

209
00:13:02,460 --> 00:13:03,365
Go kill it.

210
00:13:03,365 --> 00:13:04,246
I’m rooting for you.

211
00:13:05,415 --> 00:13:07,228
You have 10 seconds.

212
00:13:07,720 --> 00:13:08,591
10

213
00:13:10,067 --> 00:13:10,925
9

214
00:13:11,872 --> 00:13:12,626
8

215
00:13:13,960 --> 00:13:15,373
The two of us should just do it.

216
00:13:15,373 --> 00:13:16,820
But we practiced as a group of three.

217
00:13:17,167 --> 00:13:17,912
7

218
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:19,064
I’m Mok.

219
00:13:20,039 --> 00:13:20,637
Wait!

220
00:13:20,637 --> 00:13:21,862
You have to sign here!

221
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:23,526
What’s it going to be?

222
00:13:23,693 --> 00:13:25,629
Why can’t you make a decision for something this easy?

223
00:13:26,019 --> 00:13:26,778
5

224
00:13:26,778 --> 00:13:28,010
He might be on his way.

225
00:13:28,818 --> 00:13:29,679
4

226
00:13:30,710 --> 00:13:31,474
3

227
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:34,212
2

228
00:13:36,134 --> 00:13:37,193
We want to audition…

229
00:13:37,527 --> 00:13:38,321
I’m here.

230
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:44,396
I’m sorry. There was a little accident.

231
00:13:44,702 --> 00:13:45,627
Am I still in time?

232
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:47,258
In time?

233
00:13:47,648 --> 00:13:48,685
You’re too late.

234
00:13:48,840 --> 00:13:50,524
You don’t know how to be punctual.

235
00:13:51,219 --> 00:13:53,101
But it hasn’t been 10 seconds yet.

236
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:56,001
Did you guys not read the rules?

237
00:13:56,001 --> 00:13:59,573
They said you need to stand by before the audition.

238
00:14:00,001 --> 00:14:02,977
By doing this, you’re breaking the rules.

239
00:14:03,144 --> 00:14:05,381
I have the right to disqualify you.

240
00:14:05,854 --> 00:14:06,777
I’m sorry.

241
00:14:06,972 --> 00:14:08,270
Could you give me a chance?

242
00:14:09,217 --> 00:14:10,663
I really didn’t mean it.

243
00:14:10,760 --> 00:14:12,342
I’m really sorry.

244
00:14:12,869 --> 00:14:13,821
Please.

245
00:14:13,821 --> 00:14:15,105
Let’s give them a chance.

246
00:14:20,675 --> 00:14:22,773
Don’t let them say we break our word.

247
00:14:26,812 --> 00:14:28,491
(It’s Jang!)

248
00:14:29,354 --> 00:14:30,155
Okay.

249
00:14:30,545 --> 00:14:31,524
Thank you.

250
00:14:41,762 --> 00:14:42,638
Hello?

251
00:14:43,056 --> 00:14:45,517
Where are you? I want to come over.

252
00:14:46,213 --> 00:14:49,184
You’re coming to see me? Is everything alright?

253
00:14:50,243 --> 00:14:54,320
The ceramic place said our plates are ready for pickup.

254
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:55,429
Really?

255
00:14:55,687 --> 00:15:01,061
Yes, I’m going to pick them up and visit you.

256
00:15:01,590 --> 00:15:02,859
If you’re free, of course.

257
00:15:04,040 --> 00:15:06,220
It’s okay. I don’t want to trouble you.

258
00:15:06,220 --> 00:15:08,867
I’ll pick mine up myself.

259
00:15:09,898 --> 00:15:11,198
Okay. I’ll see you there.

260
00:15:11,393 --> 00:15:12,412
Alright.

261
00:15:16,534 --> 00:15:19,549
[After the audition, I have something for you.]

262
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:21,385
[You’re going to love it.]

263
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:30,317
(I shouldn’t distract him. I better wait and surprise him later.)

307
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:37,856
Calm down what?

308
00:17:37,856 --> 00:17:39,903
All our practice almost went to waste because of him.

309
00:17:39,903 --> 00:17:41,572
If he hadn’t been late, it wouldn’t have turned out this way.

310
00:17:41,767 --> 00:17:42,753
Because of me?

311
00:17:42,886 --> 00:17:43,779
I arrived in time.

312
00:17:44,191 --> 00:17:45,829
You messed up but you’re blaming me.

313
00:17:45,829 --> 00:17:47,411
If you hadn’t been late, it wouldn’t have turned out this way.

314
00:17:47,411 --> 00:17:48,798
I wouldn’t have lost focus.

315
00:17:48,798 --> 00:17:50,289
Weren’t you already distracted?

316
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:51,486
Don’t blame someone else.

317
00:17:51,486 --> 00:17:52,598
You’re in the wrong and you won’t admit it.

318
00:17:52,598 --> 00:17:53,643
Just apologize and settle it.

319
00:17:53,643 --> 00:17:55,291
You’re in the wrong too. Why don’t you admit it?

320
00:17:55,291 --> 00:17:56,326
Don’t just blame me.

321
00:18:01,006 --> 00:18:03,505
I shouldn’t have taken an irresponsible person like you on my team.

322
00:18:04,228 --> 00:18:05,085
Tae.

323
00:18:05,230 --> 00:18:06,095
What do you mean?

324
00:18:06,095 --> 00:18:06,844
Hey.

325
00:18:07,254 --> 00:18:08,495
Stop fighting.

326
00:18:09,122 --> 00:18:10,852
Tae didn’t want to make mistakes while dancing.

327
00:18:10,852 --> 00:18:12,269
You didn’t want to be late.

328
00:18:12,486 --> 00:18:14,846
It’s all in the past now. Let’s move on.

329
00:18:14,846 --> 00:18:16,778
How? This is an important opportunity.

330
00:18:17,115 --> 00:18:19,115
But we can’t go back and fix anything.

331
00:18:19,297 --> 00:18:20,984
At least, Moo arrived in time.

332
00:18:20,984 --> 00:18:22,138
Whose side are you on?

333
00:18:22,672 --> 00:18:24,093
Are you his friend or mine?

334
00:18:26,049 --> 00:18:27,518
Tae, that’s not what I mean.

335
00:18:27,518 --> 00:18:28,018
Enough.

336
00:18:28,759 --> 00:18:29,599
Tae.

337
00:18:32,420 --> 00:18:34,062
Moo, calm down.

338
00:18:40,895 --> 00:18:41,684
Hi.

339
00:18:41,684 --> 00:18:43,182
I came to pick up some stuff.

340
00:18:44,606 --> 00:18:46,443
- For Shone and Kang?
- Yes.

341
00:18:46,443 --> 00:18:47,662
They’re ready just now.

342
00:18:47,662 --> 00:18:49,029
The designs on your plates are so cute.

343
00:18:49,246 --> 00:18:49,954
Thank you.

344
00:18:50,050 --> 00:18:50,873
Please wait a moment.

345
00:18:50,873 --> 00:18:51,577
Okay.

346
00:18:55,803 --> 00:18:56,905
Hi, Shone.

347
00:18:57,484 --> 00:18:58,382
Hey, Kang.

348
00:18:59,246 --> 00:19:00,098
You’re early.

349
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:02,045
I was nearby.

350
00:19:02,865 --> 00:19:03,954
Did you get the plates?

351
00:19:04,388 --> 00:19:05,407
They’re bringing them out.

352
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,405
While we’re waiting, I have something to show you.

353
00:19:11,310 --> 00:19:12,766
I tried and put it together.

354
00:19:12,766 --> 00:19:13,609
What do you think?

355
00:19:15,104 --> 00:19:16,382
Hold on.

356
00:19:16,382 --> 00:19:17,835
You included my face?

357
00:19:17,948 --> 00:19:19,406
Who would want to see it?

358
00:19:20,323 --> 00:19:21,163
Someone would.

359
00:19:22,128 --> 00:19:24,122
I personally want to see it every day.

360
00:19:27,016 --> 00:19:27,966
Hold on.

361
00:19:28,328 --> 00:19:30,024
Why would you want to see my face?

362
00:19:32,942 --> 00:19:34,941
Well, you’re cute, so I want to see it.

363
00:19:36,243 --> 00:19:37,661
Wow.

364
00:19:38,023 --> 00:19:39,571
You stunned me.

365
00:19:40,126 --> 00:19:43,703
Even though you’re joking, I’ll take it.

366
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:48,160
I’m not joking.

367
00:19:48,566 --> 00:19:49,686
I’m serious.

368
00:19:52,410 --> 00:19:53,026
Okay.

369
00:19:55,366 --> 00:20:00,536
Would it be possible for me to hit on you?

370
00:20:01,393 --> 00:20:02,507
Would you be okay with that?

371
00:20:03,882 --> 00:20:04,501
Oh,

372
00:20:05,900 --> 00:20:09,146
I don’t know what to say.

373
00:20:10,086 --> 00:20:11,521
I’m not joking.

374
00:20:13,836 --> 00:20:15,078
I really like you, Kang.

375
00:20:19,877 --> 00:20:22,178
Thank you for liking me

376
00:20:22,178 --> 00:20:26,096
but I have someone I like already.

377
00:20:29,198 --> 00:20:30,716
Please don’t have feelings for me.

378
00:20:35,275 --> 00:20:36,409
Here you go.

379
00:20:36,940 --> 00:20:37,936
Thank you.

380
00:20:37,936 --> 00:20:38,585
You’re welcome.

381
00:20:39,043 --> 00:20:40,047
Please excuse me.

382
00:20:45,111 --> 00:20:49,260
Well, thank you for being honest with me.

383
00:20:50,255 --> 00:20:53,752
It’s totally fine that you already have someone you like

384
00:20:54,452 --> 00:20:57,354
but please let me continue having feelings for you.

385
00:20:58,680 --> 00:21:02,477
I probably can’t help how I feel.

386
00:21:05,154 --> 00:21:05,811
Yeah.

387
00:21:08,391 --> 00:21:09,110

♪ A puzzle so insolvable ♪

391
00:21:30,362 --> 00:21:32,362
I’m sorry for being a bit hot-headed.

392
00:21:33,207 --> 00:21:34,287
I got you a drink.

393
00:21:35,747 --> 00:21:36,667
It’s okay.

394
00:21:38,553 --> 00:21:39,604
I’m really sorry.

395
00:21:40,713 --> 00:21:43,275
I shouldn’t have made excuses for waking up late.

396
00:21:43,757 --> 00:21:47,185
Waking up late was really irresponsible of me like Tae said.

397
00:21:50,175 --> 00:21:52,410
It’s in the past now. Forget it.

398
00:21:53,085 --> 00:21:55,082
Where’s Tae though? I want to talk it out with him.

399
00:21:57,367 --> 00:21:58,614
I have no idea

400
00:21:59,867 --> 00:22:02,651
but I don’t think you should talk to him now.

401
00:22:02,651 --> 00:22:04,216
He’s even more hot-headed than you.

402
00:22:05,349 --> 00:22:06,482
Leave him alone for a while.

403
00:22:06,726 --> 00:22:09,447
You better wait for him to calm down before you talk to him.

404
00:22:09,833 --> 00:22:10,486
Trust me.

405
00:22:11,619 --> 00:22:13,470
I didn’t think he’d be that angry.

406
00:22:16,291 --> 00:22:17,562
I understand him.

407
00:22:18,068 --> 00:22:20,349
He’s as passionate about becoming an idol as you.

408
00:22:21,675 --> 00:22:24,817
He just wants someone to admire him.

409
00:22:25,613 --> 00:22:26,344
Why?

410
00:22:27,501 --> 00:22:29,187
He grew up alone.

411
00:22:29,686 --> 00:22:32,156
His parents are always busy with work.

412
00:22:32,349 --> 00:22:34,171
No one really cares about him.

413
00:22:35,980 --> 00:22:38,320
He wants to make his family proud.

414
00:22:38,899 --> 00:22:41,611
Despite how he looks, he deserves sympathy.

415
00:22:42,647 --> 00:22:44,206
Ah.

416
00:22:44,206 --> 00:22:45,759
You must think I’m defending him.

417
00:22:45,926 --> 00:22:46,567
No.

418
00:22:47,654 --> 00:22:49,461
I’m just curious how long it has been.

419
00:22:49,847 --> 00:22:50,504
A long time.

420
00:22:51,372 --> 00:22:53,131
He has been alone since junior high.

421
00:22:54,784 --> 00:22:55,745
What I mean is,

422
00:22:56,348 --> 00:22:57,850
how long have you been crushing on him?

423
00:22:58,405 --> 00:22:59,350
Easy, friend.

424
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,211
What do you mean crushing on him?

425
00:23:01,476 --> 00:23:02,588
I’m not crushing on him.

426
00:23:03,745 --> 00:23:04,766
I can see it.

You’re shy, aren’t you?

I won’t talk to you anymore.

00:24:09,578 --> 00:24:10,335
Yes, it is.

00:28:27,542 --> 00:28:28,938
Mala hot pot delivery.

511
00:28:30,120 --> 00:28:31,263
I ordered it too.

512
00:28:37,654 --> 00:28:38,423
Thank you.

513
00:28:43,246 --> 00:28:44,019
Here.

514
00:28:45,005 --> 00:28:46,072
It smells so good.

515
00:28:50,702 --> 00:28:51,820
How are we going to finish all this now?

516
00:28:53,869 --> 00:28:56,438
Your food is delicious and your plate is cute.

517
00:28:56,631 --> 00:28:57,948
When did you buy it?

518
00:28:58,551 --> 00:28:59,704
I didn’t buy it.

519
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:00,425
I made it.

520
00:29:00,686 --> 00:29:01,708
You made it yourself?

521
00:29:01,708 --> 00:29:02,304
Yeah.

522
00:29:03,405 --> 00:29:04,886
So cute.

523
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,164
Okay. Which Moo is cuter?

524
00:29:08,442 --> 00:29:09,936
This Moo or this Moo?

525
00:29:10,611 --> 00:29:11,618
Give it to me.

526
00:29:11,618 --> 00:29:12,457
I’ll wash it for you.

527
00:29:15,578 --> 00:29:16,735
If you’re going to wash it,

528
00:29:18,375 --> 00:29:19,438
can you wash this Moo too?

529
00:29:20,330 --> 00:29:21,174
No need.

530
00:29:31,137 --> 00:29:32,824
Oh my god.

531
00:29:35,561 --> 00:29:36,610
It’s clean now.

532
00:29:37,382 --> 00:29:38,803
My heart almost stopped.

533
00:29:39,854 --> 00:29:43,354
Now I need a doctor to give me CPR.

534
00:29:45,380 --> 00:29:46,139
Sure.

535
00:29:58,146 --> 00:30:03,934
♪ It’s too overwhelming to keep inside ♪

536
00:30:05,622 --> 00:30:06,306
That’s enough.

537
00:30:07,648 --> 00:30:08,990
I’m going to put the plate away.

538
00:30:11,572 --> 00:30:12,478
Kang.

539
00:30:12,960 --> 00:30:14,343
Kang.

540
00:30:15,581 --> 00:30:16,739
Come back!

541
00:30:18,089 --> 00:30:22,958
Moo’s special someone is Kang?

542
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:35,601
So,

543
00:30:36,697 --> 00:30:38,304
are we going to eat two pots?

544
00:30:40,575 --> 00:30:41,699
Why don’t you call Moo to join us?

545
00:30:42,237 --> 00:30:43,716
I think he wants to talk to you.

546
00:30:44,214 --> 00:30:45,124
You’re right.

547
00:30:46,479 --> 00:30:48,479
This is too much for us to finish.

548
00:30:50,312 --> 00:30:51,508
It’s really a lot.

549
00:30:56,562 --> 00:30:57,246
Hello?

550
00:30:57,366 --> 00:30:57,988
Tae,

551
00:30:58,406 --> 00:30:59,346
I’m sorry.

552
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:03,050
I was late. I was in the wrong.

553
00:31:03,687 --> 00:31:06,045
Not to mention, I foul-mouthed you.

554
00:31:07,001 --> 00:31:09,460
Hey, no worries.

555
00:31:09,591 --> 00:31:11,213
I made a mistake too.

556
00:31:11,953 --> 00:31:13,617
I was just going to call you.

557
00:31:14,294 --> 00:31:15,963
I’m eating Mala hot pot with Yos at home.

558
00:31:16,839 --> 00:31:18,101
He said I should invite you too.

559
00:31:19,936 --> 00:31:20,856
How many are you guys?

560
00:31:21,296 --> 00:31:22,986
Two. Who else should I be with?

561
00:31:23,723 --> 00:31:25,324
I won’t join you then.

562
00:31:25,683 --> 00:31:26,561
You guys enjoy it.

563
00:31:27,238 --> 00:31:28,830
Hold on, Moo.

564
00:31:29,547 --> 00:31:30,955
Do you have anything against me?

565
00:31:32,130 --> 00:31:32,931
You can say it.

566
00:31:33,409 --> 00:31:34,335
No, no.

567
00:31:34,335 --> 00:31:35,140
Nothing at all.

568
00:31:36,375 --> 00:31:37,303
I’m with Kang.

569
00:31:37,781 --> 00:31:39,338
Okay. You’re with Kang.

570
00:31:39,776 --> 00:31:41,390
I won’t interrupt you then.

571
00:31:41,908 --> 00:31:42,441
Okay?

572
00:31:42,839 --> 00:31:43,577
Okay.

573
00:31:43,876 --> 00:31:45,173
Tae, hold on. Don’t hang up yet.

574
00:31:45,392 --> 00:31:46,437
Can I talk to Yos?

575
00:31:46,995 --> 00:31:47,879
Moo wants to talk to you.

576
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:48,790
What?

577
00:31:51,818 --> 00:31:53,016
Hello, Master Moo.

578
00:31:53,016 --> 00:31:54,496
You’re alone with Tae, right?

579
00:31:55,133 --> 00:31:55,906
Yes.

580
00:31:56,424 --> 00:31:58,108
We both happened to order Mala hot pot.

581
00:31:58,447 --> 00:31:59,653
It’s really a lot.

582
00:31:59,896 --> 00:32:01,763
Actually, you can invite Kang to join us.

583
00:32:02,540 --> 00:32:04,286
No, I want to enjoy my sweet moments

584
00:32:04,631 --> 00:32:05,953
and you can enjoy your sweet moments too.

585
00:32:05,953 --> 00:32:07,815
Just the two of you. So sweet.

586
00:32:07,815 --> 00:32:08,520
So sweet, my ass.

587
00:32:08,520 --> 00:32:09,586
You’re talking nonsense.

588
00:32:09,586 --> 00:32:10,757
I’m going to deal with you, Moo.

589
00:32:10,757 --> 00:32:12,134
You’re going to get it from me.

590
00:32:15,111 --> 00:32:16,092
He really is shy.

591
00:32:16,630 --> 00:32:17,419
40 baht, please.

592
00:32:17,419 --> 00:32:17,957
Okay.

593
00:32:17,957 --> 00:32:18,498
Just a moment.

594
00:32:19,414 --> 00:32:20,274
What did Moo say?

595
00:32:21,270 --> 00:32:22,000
Nothing.

596
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:22,666
Let’s eat.

597
00:32:23,622 --> 00:32:24,339
Take it.

598
00:32:24,339 --> 00:32:24,979
Fine.

599
00:32:26,808 --> 00:32:28,718
The water is already hot. Let’s eat.

600
00:32:28,798 --> 00:32:29,700
What should I eat?

601
00:32:30,416 --> 00:32:31,369
I’ll start with the beef.

602
00:32:33,202 --> 00:32:34,222
I’ll put the vegetables in.

603
00:32:46,313 --> 00:32:47,018
You take it.

604
00:32:47,157 --> 00:32:48,388
No, you take it.

605
00:32:48,388 --> 00:32:49,355
You take it.

606
00:32:50,169 --> 00:32:50,837
Why?

607
00:32:51,315 --> 00:32:52,448
Are you secretly crushing on me?

608
00:32:56,933 --> 00:32:57,594
Nonsense.

609
00:32:59,676 --> 00:33:00,696
Eat a lot of vegetables.

610
00:33:01,340 --> 00:33:02,242
What’s wrong with you?

611
00:33:02,576 --> 00:33:04,137
You gave me your heart.

612
00:33:04,555 --> 00:33:05,707
I’ll give you my heart too.

613
00:33:05,976 --> 00:33:07,643
Give it to your girls.

614
00:33:08,778 --> 00:33:09,309
What do you want to eat?

615
00:33:09,309 --> 00:33:09,978
I’ll feed you.

616
00:33:11,334 --> 00:33:11,895
Here.

617
00:33:12,353 --> 00:33:12,918
Eat it.

618
00:33:13,576 --> 00:33:14,291
Eat it.

619
00:33:14,291 --> 00:33:15,000
I’ll get it myself.

620
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:16,006
No, open your mouth.

621
00:33:16,006 --> 00:33:16,975

You really came.

I saw him.

636
00:33:58,077 --> 00:34:00,004
He sells rice and curry next to your dorm, right?

637
00:34:00,303 --> 00:34:02,029
What? You were stalking me?

638
00:34:02,547 --> 00:34:04,435
What do you think? He’s cute, right?

639
00:34:04,873 --> 00:34:06,666
He’s so stubborn but so cute.

640
00:34:06,766 --> 00:34:07,455
Yeah,

641
00:34:08,471 --> 00:34:09,483
he’s cute.

642
00:34:10,856 --> 00:34:12,005
Kang is cute.

643
00:34:12,284 --> 00:34:12,935
Yes.

644
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:15,020
Hold on.

645
00:34:15,697 --> 00:34:17,409
Did I tell you his name?

646
00:34:18,983 --> 00:34:23,328
Remember I said I came here to film for my show?

647
00:34:23,736 --> 00:34:24,338
Yeah.

648
00:34:25,318 --> 00:34:28,258
Kang was my tour guide.

649
00:34:31,256 --> 00:34:33,104
But where did you go today and with whom?

650
00:34:33,622 --> 00:34:35,122
Someone asked me to be a tour guide.

651
00:34:35,122 --> 00:34:37,705
Come on. Let me see his face.

652
00:34:37,705 --> 00:34:38,409
No.

653
00:34:39,027 --> 00:34:40,402
We’re not together yet.

654
00:34:40,761 --> 00:34:43,202
Don’t steal him from me. I know what you’re trying to do.

655
00:34:43,202 --> 00:34:44,623
I’m not going to steal him from you.

656
00:34:44,703 --> 00:34:47,024
I already have eyes on someone else.

657
00:34:47,515 --> 00:34:48,298
Who is it?

658
00:34:48,716 --> 00:34:50,439
I’m not sure how things will go yet.

659
00:34:50,439 --> 00:34:52,760
Once I am, I’ll introduce him to you.

660
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:53,856
I got to go.

661
00:34:53,856 --> 00:34:54,750
I need to edit my video.

662
00:34:56,383 --> 00:34:59,051
Don’t tell me the guy you’re interested in is

663
00:35:00,645 --> 00:35:01,250
Kang.

664
00:35:07,784 --> 00:35:08,471
Hey.

665
00:35:09,547 --> 00:35:10,736
Don’t give me that face.

666
00:35:11,692 --> 00:35:12,894
How could that be?

667
00:35:14,328 --> 00:35:15,398
You’re overthinking.

668
00:35:16,553 --> 00:35:18,166
Look at that frown.

669
00:35:20,296 --> 00:35:22,113
You just said Kang is cute.

670
00:35:23,886 --> 00:35:25,572
He’s cute but that’s irrelevant.

671
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:27,746
I only met him once.

672
00:35:28,164 --> 00:35:29,727
I’m not going to make a move or anything.

673
00:35:31,002 --> 00:35:31,502
Bro,

674
00:35:31,980 --> 00:35:34,161
if something is going on with you, you can tell me.

675
00:35:34,719 --> 00:35:37,164
I don’t want this to come between us.

676
00:35:37,503 --> 00:35:39,489
I want to talk it out with you honestly.

677
00:35:39,489 --> 00:35:40,297
Let’s settle this once and for all.

678
00:35:41,034 --> 00:35:41,598
Okay?

679
00:35:43,690 --> 00:35:46,294
Love really does make people grow up, huh?

680
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:49,805
Seeing how scary my rival is,

681
00:35:50,056 --> 00:35:51,167
I don’t dare hit on him anymore.

682
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:53,200
Don’t joke with me.

683
00:35:53,678 --> 00:35:54,566
I’m serious.

684
00:35:54,763 --> 00:35:55,887
Me too.

685
00:35:56,345 --> 00:35:57,791
I don’t have feelings for Kang.

686
00:35:58,528 --> 00:35:59,418
You’re overthinking.

687
00:36:00,753 --> 00:36:03,303
Aren’t you going to give that ice cream to Kang?

688
00:36:03,562 --> 00:36:04,324
Yes.

689
00:36:04,324 --> 00:36:05,451
I should go.

690
00:36:05,451 --> 00:36:06,191
It’s melting.

691
00:36:18,091 --> 00:36:22,999
Moo’s special someone is Kang?

692
00:36:39,554 --> 00:36:40,823
Are you alright, Moo?

693
00:36:43,413 --> 00:36:44,705
Just lost in my thoughts.

694
00:36:45,856 --> 00:36:47,253
Are you stressed about the audition?

695
00:36:48,807 --> 00:36:50,848
Yes, I’m scared I’ll fail.

696
00:36:53,677 --> 00:36:54,754
You did your best.

697
00:36:55,949 --> 00:36:57,079
Don’t worry.

698
00:36:58,195 --> 00:36:59,750
I believe you’ll pass.

699
00:37:00,759 --> 00:37:01,814
Thank you, Kang.

700
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:07,331
By the way, I want to predict our fortune.

701
00:37:09,861 --> 00:37:10,744
Predict what?

702
00:37:11,999 --> 00:37:15,730
By using moon blocks. Those two red wooden blocks found at temples.

703
00:37:16,069 --> 00:37:17,641
We make a wish and throw them.

704
00:37:17,860 --> 00:37:20,808
If one block lands face down and the other face up,

705
00:37:20,856 --> 00:37:23,117
it means our wish will come true.

706
00:37:23,117 --> 00:37:23,847
Have you seen them?

707
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,573
Oh, I know what you’re talking about.

708
00:37:28,776 --> 00:37:31,693
But you don’t look like you’d know those kinds of things.

709
00:37:32,490 --> 00:37:36,016
Come on. I used to go to the temples with my grandma often.

710
00:37:36,720 --> 00:37:37,500
Anyway,

711
00:37:38,536 --> 00:37:40,401
the other day you already blessed me with a forehead kiss.

712
00:37:40,700 --> 00:37:42,782
Today, can you be my moon blocks?

713
00:37:47,001 --> 00:37:47,798
Mr. Moon Blocks,

714
00:37:48,595 --> 00:37:50,033
will I pass the audition?

715
00:37:57,821 --> 00:37:58,450
Yes.

716
00:38:00,143 --> 00:38:01,747
Let’s do it again. It’s fun.

717
00:38:01,776 --> 00:38:03,066
I’ll pass the audition, right?

718
00:38:06,652 --> 00:38:07,817
I said you will.

719
00:38:07,817 --> 00:38:08,886
Why do you keep asking the same thing?

720
00:38:08,886 --> 00:38:09,897
It’s fun.

721
00:38:10,136 --> 00:38:11,202
I want to play this in my room.

722
00:38:11,541 --> 00:38:12,243
You can’t.

723
00:38:14,733 --> 00:38:16,185
If I can’t play this in my room,

724
00:38:16,185 --> 00:38:17,461
let me ask one more question.

725
00:38:20,011 --> 00:38:20,760
Mr. Moon Blocks,

726
00:38:22,055 --> 00:38:24,409
Kang, do you love me?

727
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,966
♪ I know you don’t like if I call you my boo ♪

728
00:38:41,966 --> 00:38:45,165
♪ Then what word can express how much I cherish you ♪

729
00:38:45,165 --> 00:38:46,712
Mr. Moon Blocks, please answer me.

730
00:38:47,311 --> 00:38:48,372
Do you love me?

731
00:38:48,656 --> 00:38:50,788
Do you love me? Please answer.

732
00:38:50,987 --> 00:38:51,944
Mr. Moon Blocks?

733
00:38:52,641 --> 00:38:53,797
Do you love me?

734
00:38:53,797 --> 00:38:55,063
I want some encouragement.

735
00:38:55,856 --> 00:38:56,927
Stop it.

736
00:38:57,126 --> 00:38:58,410
Don’t get too comfortable just because I’m playing along.

737
00:38:58,769 --> 00:39:00,019
So what?

738
00:39:01,991 --> 00:39:04,388
♪ Oh e oh hey baby ♪

739
00:39:04,388 --> 00:39:06,970
♪ Oh Please tell me ♪

740
00:39:06,970 --> 00:39:11,535
♪ I know you know but baby would you stay ♪

741
00:39:11,535 --> 00:39:14,358
♪ Oh e oh hey baby ♪

742
00:39:14,358 --> 00:39:16,856
♪ Oh Please tell me ♪

743
00:39:16,856 --> 00:39:20,232
♪ I know you know but baby could you say  ♪

744
00:39:20,777 --> 00:39:22,777
A FEW DAYS LATER

745
00:39:35,469 --> 00:39:37,510
Why haven’t we received any emails?

746
00:39:39,111 --> 00:39:41,111
You just checked 5 minutes ago.

747
00:39:43,102 --> 00:39:45,495
It’s been almost a month but we’ve got no emails

748
00:39:45,495 --> 00:39:46,537
or calls.

749
00:39:47,347 --> 00:39:48,546
Not even unfamiliar numbers.

750
00:39:49,012 --> 00:39:50,770
Have you received any calls from unfamiliar numbers?

751
00:39:51,317 --> 00:39:52,012
Of course.

752
00:39:52,134 --> 00:39:53,052
Only in the form of friends.

753
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:54,056
What friends?

754
00:39:54,056 --> 00:39:54,811
Scammer friends.

755
00:40:00,230 --> 00:40:03,294
Did we fail the audition?

756
00:40:05,542 --> 00:40:06,723
I think we definitely passed.

757
00:40:07,169 --> 00:40:07,829
Trust me.

758
00:40:14,411 --> 00:40:15,078
Hey!

759
00:40:15,706 --> 00:40:16,656
It’s an unfamiliar number.

760
00:40:18,864 --> 00:40:19,856
Answer it for me.

761
00:40:19,856 --> 00:40:21,218
Hurry!

762
00:40:21,428 --> 00:40:22,964
Damn, it’s really an unfamiliar number.

763
00:40:22,964 --> 00:40:24,025
It looks like the number on the page.

764
00:40:24,025 --> 00:40:24,979
Answer it.

765
00:40:25,911 --> 00:40:27,192
Damn, they’re calling me too.

766
00:40:27,759 --> 00:40:28,489
Come on.

767
00:40:28,489 --> 00:40:29,504
Let me answer it for you.

768
00:40:29,504 --> 00:40:31,386
If it’s a scammer, I’ll tell them off.

769
00:40:32,149 --> 00:40:32,912
Go for it.

770
00:40:32,912 --> 00:40:33,412
Come on.

771
00:40:37,191 --> 00:40:37,799
Hello?

772
00:40:37,799 --> 00:40:39,396
Hi, I’m calling from the New Wave Project.

773
00:40:39,396 --> 00:40:41,838
Is this Pheera Tiensuwan’s number?

774
00:40:41,838 --> 00:40:42,350
Yes.

775
00:40:43,707 --> 00:40:45,620
You passed the audition, Pheera.

776
00:40:45,620 --> 00:40:46,213
Really?

777
00:40:46,476 --> 00:40:47,280
Thank you so much.

778
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:50,563
Yos,

779
00:40:52,456 --> 00:40:53,340
you passed the audition.

780
00:40:56,682 --> 00:40:57,251
Really?

781
00:40:58,697 --> 00:40:59,197
What about me?

782
00:41:05,901 --> 00:41:06,625
I passed, right?

783
00:41:22,226 --> 00:41:23,178
Did I fail?

784
00:41:25,066 --> 00:41:25,697
Tae.

785
00:41:28,735 --> 00:41:29,625
Say it.

786
00:41:32,201 --> 00:41:33,444
It’s okay.

787
00:41:35,631 --> 00:41:37,524
We can try again together next time.

788
00:41:47,238 --> 00:41:47,797
Tae.

789
00:41:48,101 --> 00:41:49,161
Don’t follow me now.

790
00:41:52,503 --> 00:41:53,432
I beg you.

791
00:42:18,255 --> 00:42:18,852
Kang.

792
00:42:20,492 --> 00:42:21,185
Hey, Moo.

793
00:42:22,218 --> 00:42:23,013
When did you get here?

794
00:42:23,640 --> 00:42:24,511
What do you want to eat today?

795
00:42:25,827 --> 00:42:27,504
Do you want to eat Kai Yad Sai instead of Kai Palo?

796
00:42:28,987 --> 00:42:29,836
Can I hug you?

797
00:42:34,130 --> 00:42:34,957
What’s wrong?

798
00:42:36,251 --> 00:42:37,360
I didn’t pass the audition.

799
00:42:40,054 --> 00:42:41,118
I couldn’t make it.

800
00:42:41,422 --> 00:42:42,268
It’s okay.

801
00:42:42,693 --> 00:42:44,011
Now I can’t ask you to be my boyfriend.

802
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:46,614
Why did I fail?

803
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:49,039
Take it easy.

804
00:42:52,279 --> 00:42:53,594
When I move abroad,

805
00:42:55,620 --> 00:42:57,417
I won’t see you anymore, right?

806
00:43:02,765 --> 00:43:03,343
You will now.

807
00:43:04,234 --> 00:43:05,132
Here I am.

808
00:43:08,514 --> 00:43:11,519
I’m still right here in front of you.

809
00:43:15,712 --> 00:43:17,556
We’re still here together.

810
00:43:19,683 --> 00:43:22,993
Let’s make the most of the time we have now.

811
00:43:24,566 --> 00:43:25,630
Okay.

812
00:43:27,270 --> 00:43:28,424
You like me, right?

813
00:43:30,957 --> 00:43:32,126
I more than like you.

814
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:35,971
I’ve never met someone like you.

815
00:43:40,216 --> 00:43:44,715
And I've never felt as strongly about anyone as I do for you.

816
00:43:50,977 --> 00:43:55,619
But I’m not so sure about being boyfriends yet.

817
00:43:57,786 --> 00:43:59,091
Let me predict our fortune.

818
00:44:05,949 --> 00:44:07,114
Will Moo and I

819
00:44:09,544 --> 00:44:10,837
become boyfriends?

820
00:44:52,402 --> 00:44:56,509
Even though you didn’t pass the audition and can’t ask me to be your boyfriend,

821
00:44:58,221 --> 00:44:59,654
I can ask you to be mine.

822
00:45:03,740 --> 00:45:04,742
Will you be my boyfriend, Moo?

823
00:45:08,550 --> 00:45:10,724
Yes, my Kang.

00:46:24,702 --> 00:46:25,856
I got everything planned.

838
00:46:26,259 --> 00:46:27,477
I don’t think we can do it all in one day.

839
00:46:27,720 --> 00:46:29,291
Who says we’ll do it all in one day?

840
00:46:29,291 --> 00:46:31,181
I plan to do this with you for the rest of my life.

841
00:46:32,336 --> 00:46:33,108
Are you shy?

842
00:46:33,513 --> 00:46:35,069
(Besides love, my dream is on the rise.)

843
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:36,926
I want your team to audition again.

844
00:46:37,504 --> 00:46:38,694
Your opportunity has come.

845
00:46:39,117 --> 00:46:40,813
I think it’s time to confess your feelings to Tae.

846
00:46:42,236 --> 00:46:43,018
I like you.

847
00:46:44,719 --> 00:46:46,579
Can I get a graduation gift?

848
00:46:47,025 --> 00:46:47,931
Even if you didn’t ask,

849
00:46:48,660 --> 00:46:49,656
I’d give it anyway.

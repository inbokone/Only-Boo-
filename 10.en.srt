00:11:37,722 --> 00:11:41,527
They want a guarantee that their investment will bring the maximum benefit.

190
00:11:42,106 --> 00:11:42,885
You understand, right?

191
00:11:43,238 --> 00:11:43,840
Yes.

192
00:11:45,804 --> 00:11:47,378
Why do you ask though?

193
00:11:47,781 --> 00:11:48,734
Are you already seeing someone?

194
00:11:50,144 --> 00:11:51,078
No.

195
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:52,614
I’m just curious.

196
00:11:53,722 --> 00:11:56,328
Or do you have a crush on someone?

197
00:12:05,771 --> 00:12:07,510
Not anymore.

198
00:12:25,968 --> 00:12:28,900
Moo, why haven’t you taken a shower?

199
00:12:32,023 --> 00:12:33,055
I’m resting.

200
00:12:38,167 --> 00:12:39,373
Is something wrong?

201
00:12:42,773 --> 00:12:43,608
No.

202
00:12:44,489 --> 00:12:45,346
Moo,

203
00:12:47,134 --> 00:12:48,415
tell me what’s wrong.

204
00:12:49,120 --> 00:12:50,627
Let’s not keep any secrets between us.

205
00:12:51,836 --> 00:12:53,555
If there’s a problem, let’s solve it together.

206
00:13:03,279 --> 00:13:07,135
The contract says I can’t date.

207
00:13:11,466 --> 00:13:12,212
Really?

208
00:13:13,924 --> 00:13:14,986
You don’t need to read it.

209
00:13:21,487 --> 00:13:22,840
So what do we have to do?

210
00:13:25,408 --> 00:13:26,602
I don’t know

211
00:13:28,063 --> 00:13:30,646
but I will definitely not break up with you.

212
00:13:33,114 --> 00:13:34,616
Are you going to give up being an idol?

213
00:13:35,623 --> 00:13:36,407
No.

214
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:41,725
Will it be okay if you don’t sign it?

215
00:13:44,722 --> 00:13:45,720
I don’t know.

216
00:13:47,735 --> 00:13:51,490
You said we can work towards dreams and reality at the same time

217
00:13:52,497 --> 00:13:53,977
but this is not it.

218
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:56,442
I’ve worked so hard.

219
00:13:57,550 --> 00:14:01,209
I don’t understand why the contract prohibits us from dating.

220
00:14:01,436 --> 00:14:02,542
Calm down, Moo.

221
00:14:03,524 --> 00:14:05,160
Every problem has a solution.

222
00:14:06,898 --> 00:14:08,396
Is this where I choose

223
00:14:08,975 --> 00:14:11,551
whether I want to date you or become an idol?

224
00:14:20,760 --> 00:14:22,148
[Mok Diloksakulkan]

225
00:14:22,603 --> 00:14:25,392
Welcome to TTM.

226
00:14:34,406 --> 00:14:35,690
I don’t want to do this.

227
00:14:38,420 --> 00:14:39,362
I understand you.

228
00:14:39,709 --> 00:14:40,957
But this is how the world is.

229
00:14:41,542 --> 00:14:43,195
You don’t get everything you want.

230
00:14:44,148 --> 00:14:47,189
Now that you’ve chosen this path, go to the finish line.

231
00:14:50,157 --> 00:14:51,335
So you signed it?

232
00:14:52,505 --> 00:14:53,074
Yes.

233
00:14:54,244 --> 00:14:55,271
Have you signed it?

234
00:14:56,116 --> 00:14:56,858
Yes.

235
00:14:57,465 --> 00:14:58,889
My relationship hasn’t even begun.

236
00:14:58,889 --> 00:15:00,014
It’s so much easier to end than yours.

237
00:15:01,011 --> 00:15:01,815
Are you okay?

238
00:15:03,093 --> 00:15:03,593
Of course.

239
00:15:04,416 --> 00:15:05,540
I’m fine.

240
00:15:05,670 --> 00:15:08,043
I’m rooting for you though.

241
00:15:17,522 --> 00:15:21,271
If you were me, what would you do?

242
00:15:22,419 --> 00:15:25,564
I would date in secret and hide it from everyone.

243
00:15:25,889 --> 00:15:26,644
You’re right.

244
00:15:27,316 --> 00:15:29,235
But if people find out,

245
00:15:29,473 --> 00:15:30,551
you’ll be in big trouble.

246
00:15:31,331 --> 00:15:32,299
It’s going to be okay.

247
00:15:32,906 --> 00:15:36,258
We just have to pretend we don’t know each other when we’re outside.

248
00:15:36,496 --> 00:15:38,672
That’s enough to hide it from people.

249
00:15:38,975 --> 00:15:40,598
But I think it’s too risky.

250
00:15:41,204 --> 00:15:41,927
Kang,

251
00:15:43,032 --> 00:15:43,848
trust me.

252
00:15:45,083 --> 00:15:46,424
Please trust me like you always have.

253
00:15:48,374 --> 00:15:49,253
Alright, I’m in.

254
00:16:00,760 --> 00:16:03,903
So, this means we can only see each other inside the room.

255
00:16:06,135 --> 00:16:07,692
We can still see each other outside.

256
00:16:07,692 --> 00:16:09,670
Not many people know me yet.

257
00:16:11,013 --> 00:16:15,042
People here mind their own business,  but we have to be careful at the company.

258
00:16:15,042 --> 00:16:16,150
Keep moving.

259
00:16:16,150 --> 00:16:17,289
1, 2.

260
00:16:17,982 --> 00:16:18,710
Give me cool.

261
00:16:18,710 --> 00:16:19,592
Give me strong.

262
00:16:19,917 --> 00:16:20,420
Good.

263
00:16:20,420 --> 00:16:21,503
1, 2.

264
00:16:21,676 --> 00:16:23,702
Give me your brightest smile.

265
00:16:23,875 --> 00:16:25,115
Okay. That’s good.

266
00:16:25,267 --> 00:16:26,487
Next team, please.

267
00:16:26,487 --> 00:16:29,176
Why did it take you so little time to move on from Kang?

268
00:16:29,826 --> 00:16:32,825
You’re so much stronger than me.

269
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,677
(Sorry for keeping it from you, Yos.)

270
00:16:36,677 --> 00:16:38,102
(I don’t want to put you at risk.)

271
00:16:38,102 --> 00:16:41,204
So we can only see each other at the condo.

272
00:16:41,204 --> 00:16:43,018
No, we can go to other places too.

273
00:16:43,321 --> 00:16:44,484
One ticket, please.

274
00:16:45,091 --> 00:16:46,162
[You’re smart.]

275
00:16:46,530 --> 00:16:50,125
[Of course. I’ve watched all the spy movies.]

276
00:16:50,125 --> 00:16:52,407
[No one is going to catch us. Trust me!]

277
00:16:53,800 --> 00:16:55,589
Really, I’m not that famous.

278
00:16:55,589 --> 00:16:56,617
People won’t really care about me.

279
00:16:56,617 --> 00:16:59,210
Are you Moo? Can I get a photo with you?

280
00:16:59,362 --> 00:17:00,413
Yes, of course.

281
00:17:00,413 --> 00:17:03,530
In the unexpected event that someone recognizes me,

282
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,056
we just have to pretend we didn’t come together.

283
00:17:05,056 --> 00:17:06,559
That’s it.

284
00:17:08,336 --> 00:17:10,226
Thank you.

285
00:17:19,803 --> 00:17:20,494
Hello.

286
00:17:21,274 --> 00:17:24,268
Did you forget your green tea outside?

287
00:17:25,070 --> 00:17:26,255
I brought it for you.

288
00:17:26,840 --> 00:17:28,399
I bought it for my partner.

289
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:30,868
Why did you take the liberty of picking it up?

290
00:17:33,468 --> 00:17:34,605
What’s your partner’s name?

291
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:36,412
His name is Moo.

292
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:39,077
What a coincidence.

293
00:17:39,770 --> 00:17:41,025
That’s my name too.

294
00:17:41,827 --> 00:17:43,032
I guess we’re the same person.

295
00:17:55,868 --> 00:17:56,863
This is the most refreshing.

296
00:18:02,523 --> 00:18:03,205
Mr. Kang,

297
00:18:04,440 --> 00:18:05,640
can I hold your hand?

298
00:18:29,019 --> 00:18:29,786
Kang.

299
00:18:30,479 --> 00:18:31,075
Hmm?

300
00:18:31,443 --> 00:18:32,324
I love you.

301
00:18:35,422 --> 00:18:36,301
I love you too.

302
00:18:46,471 --> 00:18:47,816
I’m in front of the cinema now.

303
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:51,821
Moo.

304
00:18:52,254 --> 00:18:53,562
How did the movie end?

305
00:18:54,364 --> 00:18:56,041
If you want to know, why didn’t you stay and watch the ending?

306
00:18:56,583 --> 00:18:58,691
I had to leave early.

307
00:18:58,799 --> 00:18:59,687
How did the movie end?

308
00:19:01,117 --> 00:19:01,858
I won’t tell you.

309
00:19:02,508 --> 00:19:03,426
You won’t tell me?

310
00:19:04,206 --> 00:19:05,106
Hey, what are you doing?

311
00:19:05,106 --> 00:19:05,709
Will you tell me now?

312
00:19:06,511 --> 00:19:07,011
I won’t.

313
00:19:08,658 --> 00:19:09,485
Fine.

314
00:19:09,702 --> 00:19:10,409
You won’t tell me, huh?

315
00:19:13,962 --> 00:19:14,655
Will you tell me now?

316
00:19:14,980 --> 00:19:15,719
I won’t.

00:19:22,740 --> 00:19:23,593

343

00:23:15,958 --> 00:23:16,730
Really?

373
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:17,296
Yes.

374
00:23:17,513 --> 00:23:18,731
Congratulations, Moo.

375
00:23:21,396 --> 00:23:24,331
I got to where I am today because you never let go of my hand.

376
00:23:25,219 --> 00:23:26,218
I’ve missed you so much.

377
00:23:27,475 --> 00:23:29,340
I’ve missed being near you.

378
00:23:30,120 --> 00:23:31,399
Kissing you.

379
00:23:32,764 --> 00:23:34,750
And smelling you.

380
00:23:36,093 --> 00:23:37,437
I’ve missed you too.

381
00:23:38,304 --> 00:23:42,039
You’re only a few steps away from reaching the summit of your Everest.

382
00:23:44,271 --> 00:23:44,982
Let me give you a hug.

383
00:23:48,167 --> 00:23:49,158
Well done.

384
00:23:49,743 --> 00:23:50,497
Thank you.

385
00:23:54,852 --> 00:23:56,851
Let’s go watch the movie.

386
00:23:57,176 --> 00:23:59,787
♪ Let’s finally be in love ♪

387
00:24:06,489 --> 00:24:07,704
Stop practicing.

388
00:24:14,204 --> 00:24:16,089
You’re getting the company in trouble, Moo.

389
00:24:17,086 --> 00:24:17,753
Me?

390
00:24:20,254 --> 00:24:22,662
Someone dug up a clip of you with your boyfriend and leaked it.

391
00:24:30,984 --> 00:24:31,984
I’ve seen it.

392
00:24:32,140 --> 00:24:33,055
That’s an old clip.

393
00:24:33,211 --> 00:24:37,210
I already deleted the clip and sorted myself out as promised.

394
00:24:37,962 --> 00:24:40,851
But I have proof that you lied when you signed the contract.

395
00:24:47,659 --> 00:24:48,828
That’s probably a long time ago.

396
00:24:48,828 --> 00:24:50,235
I haven’t seen him in ages.

397
00:24:51,168 --> 00:24:52,120
Don’t lie.

398
00:24:55,975 --> 00:24:56,861
What do you mean?

399
00:24:59,947 --> 00:25:00,922
Let me give you a hug.

400
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,593
Did you take that photo?

401
00:25:11,034 --> 00:25:12,440
So you admit it?

402
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:13,826
Why did you do that?

403
00:25:14,604 --> 00:25:15,928
You’re selfish.

404
00:25:16,369 --> 00:25:18,084
You’re not serious about being an idol.

405
00:25:18,680 --> 00:25:20,946
You even lie to the fans who love us so much.

406
00:25:21,465 --> 00:25:23,083
You dare violate the contract

407
00:25:23,420 --> 00:25:24,902
because you’re a nepo baby.

408
00:25:24,902 --> 00:25:27,167
You think because your mom has power, you can do anything.

409
00:25:27,167 --> 00:25:28,117
- My mom has nothing to do with this. - Hey.

410
00:25:28,117 --> 00:25:30,233
If your mom really had nothing to do with this, you wouldn’t have become a trainee.

411
00:25:30,233 --> 00:25:31,586
I said my mom has nothing to do with this!

412
00:25:31,586 --> 00:25:32,205
Bring it on!

413
00:25:32,646 --> 00:25:33,570
Moo!

414
00:25:33,881 --> 00:25:34,590
Stop!

415
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:37,045
Follow me outside.

416
00:25:40,467 --> 00:25:41,772
Moo didn’t want to lie.

417
00:25:41,772 --> 00:25:42,415
Tae!

418
00:25:45,811 --> 00:25:48,700
I was the one who suggested he date in secret.

419
00:25:51,085 --> 00:25:53,022
Moo made his own decision to lie.

420
00:25:53,680 --> 00:25:55,484
It doesn’t matter who gave him the idea.

421
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,574
What matters is that Moo caused this problem.

422
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:01,815
Follow me.

423
00:26:09,541 --> 00:26:10,596
Sorry.

424
00:26:15,055 --> 00:26:16,961
Is there anything you want to tell me, Tae?

425
00:26:26,269 --> 00:26:29,098
Why didn’t I know about Moo secretly dating Kang?

426
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:30,981
Did I become an outsider?

427
00:26:31,137 --> 00:26:32,437
Why did you keep a secret from me?

428
00:26:33,630 --> 00:26:34,969
I didn’t want you to tell Jang.

429
00:26:36,810 --> 00:26:38,492
Why do you ask though?

430
00:26:38,959 --> 00:26:39,822
Are you already seeing someone?
No.

431
00:26:40,237 --> 00:26:42,875
I’m just curious.

432
00:26:43,860 --> 00:26:46,451
Or do you have a crush on someone?

433
00:26:47,281 --> 00:26:48,961
Not anymore.

434
00:26:54,027 --> 00:26:54,996
What’s wrong with you?

435
00:26:55,618 --> 00:26:57,260
You seem very close to him these days.

436
00:26:58,810 --> 00:27:00,173
Even closer to him than me.

437
00:27:00,173 --> 00:27:00,991
Why are you being sarcastic?

438
00:27:03,013 --> 00:27:03,882
I’m not.

439
00:27:04,867 --> 00:27:06,220
If you didn’t spend all your time with him,

440
00:27:07,036 --> 00:27:09,724
you would’ve known everything without me having to tell you.

441
00:27:11,461 --> 00:27:12,495
Forget it.

442
00:27:13,532 --> 00:27:15,295
It’s not a secret anymore.

443
00:27:16,151 --> 00:27:17,299
Everyone knows now.

444
00:27:20,721 --> 00:27:23,076
I can remove you from the trainee program,

445
00:27:23,257 --> 00:27:24,440
but it would be a pity.

446
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:26,802
You’ve made it all the way here

447
00:27:26,802 --> 00:27:29,261
and your popularity is on the rise.

448
00:27:29,468 --> 00:27:30,923
I think you need to choose

449
00:27:31,200 --> 00:27:33,212
before this thing comes back to hurt you.

450
00:27:33,240 --> 00:27:36,520
If Porsche hadn’t told the others, no one would know I’m dating.

451
00:27:36,520 --> 00:27:38,158
Don’t blame someone else.

452
00:27:38,158 --> 00:27:40,595
You know very well you’re lying to everyone

453
00:27:40,595 --> 00:27:41,997
and breaking the company’s rules.

454
00:27:42,386 --> 00:27:44,200
I’ll give you a chance to think again.

455
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:46,665
If you still insist on breaking our rules,

456
00:27:48,065 --> 00:27:50,786
we may have to reconsider your future with us.

457
00:28:01,001 --> 00:28:02,346
You’re right.

458
00:28:03,487 --> 00:28:05,754
Being friends doesn’t mean we can’t keep secrets from each other.

459
00:28:05,754 --> 00:28:06,546
Yeah.

460
00:28:08,153 --> 00:28:10,958
Even I kept my feelings for you hidden for so long.

461
00:28:16,299 --> 00:28:17,182
And…

462
00:28:18,680 --> 00:28:20,008
what are your feelings now?

463
00:28:27,630 --> 00:28:30,528
If you don’t want to talk about it, you can write.

464
00:28:46,076 --> 00:28:47,040
[Friends.]

465
00:28:48,933 --> 00:28:49,725
Friends?

466
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:51,239
Yeah.

467
00:29:02,673 --> 00:29:03,289
Okay.

468
00:29:04,663 --> 00:29:05,478
Friends, right?

469
00:29:05,789 --> 00:29:06,423
Yeah.

470
00:29:16,586 --> 00:29:19,408
(I know I can only be your friend.)

471
00:29:20,626 --> 00:29:21,566

479
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:15,608
We finished early today.

480
00:30:15,971 --> 00:30:16,932
I’m back at the condo.

481
00:30:18,125 --> 00:30:18,915
That’s good.

482
00:30:20,134 --> 00:30:21,554
Now you have time to rest.

483
00:30:22,747 --> 00:30:24,190
I’m so tired today.

484
00:30:24,579 --> 00:30:26,663
If I could eat your Kai Palo,

485
00:30:27,674 --> 00:30:28,674
I’d be so happy.

486
00:30:29,737 --> 00:30:31,535
If eating it will make you feel better,

487
00:30:32,183 --> 00:30:33,517
I’ll make it for you.

488
00:30:34,373 --> 00:30:35,704
Are you coming to see me?

489
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:38,197
Yeah.

490
00:30:39,182 --> 00:30:40,277
You want to eat it, right?

491
00:30:41,418 --> 00:30:42,303
Thank you.

492
00:30:49,150 --> 00:30:53,649
The company has found out about you and Moo dating in secret.

493
00:30:54,557 --> 00:30:57,287
This is about the contract he signed,

494
00:30:57,624 --> 00:31:00,383
so they informed me too.

495
00:31:02,457 --> 00:31:09,614
I’ve seen Moo try so many times to become an idol like he dreams of.

496
00:31:11,299 --> 00:31:13,784
I’ve never agreed with him.

497
00:31:15,469 --> 00:31:16,651
But today,

498
00:31:17,740 --> 00:31:21,188
he’s achieved his dream.

499
00:31:21,940 --> 00:31:26,201
I don’t want all his effort to go to waste.

500
00:31:27,834 --> 00:31:33,280
I don’t know what you will decide, Kang,

501
00:31:35,017 --> 00:31:41,316
but what I know for sure is Moo listens to you more than anyone.

502
00:31:43,364 --> 00:31:49,180
So I’m asking you to think carefully,
whether you’re going to use your heart or reason.

503
00:31:49,802 --> 00:31:51,660
It’s your call.

504
00:32:16,918 --> 00:32:17,567
Moo.

505
00:32:19,952 --> 00:32:20,702
Hey.

506
00:32:23,528 --> 00:32:24,136
Here.

507
00:32:24,473 --> 00:32:26,039
Take your Kai Palo.

508
00:32:27,024 --> 00:32:28,003
You want to eat it, right?

509
00:32:29,351 --> 00:32:30,748
I didn’t come out to get Kai Palo.

510
00:32:30,852 --> 00:32:32,063
I came to get you.

511
00:32:33,126 --> 00:32:34,312
Let’s eat this in my room.

512
00:32:38,512 --> 00:32:39,414
Is that okay?

513
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:42,965
Please.

514
00:32:45,170 --> 00:32:46,160
Is something wrong?

515
00:32:46,834 --> 00:32:47,680
No.

516
00:32:48,017 --> 00:32:48,729
Let’s go.

517
00:33:04,174 --> 00:33:05,413
What are you doing, Moo?

518
00:33:06,035 --> 00:33:07,417
People will recognize you.

519
00:33:08,680 --> 00:33:09,828
There’s no one here.

520
00:33:09,984 --> 00:33:10,849
It’s okay.

521
00:33:12,819 --> 00:33:14,588
You’re in trouble now.

522
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,389
I’m worried about you.

523
00:33:24,285 --> 00:33:25,139
Kang,

524
00:33:25,735 --> 00:33:27,292
I’m trying to solve the problem.

525
00:33:27,499 --> 00:33:28,680
Don’t worry.

526
00:33:31,117 --> 00:33:32,218
Whose boyfriend are you?

527
00:33:33,255 --> 00:33:34,400
You’re so cute.

528
00:33:36,915 --> 00:33:37,931
Your boyfriend.

529
00:33:39,279 --> 00:33:40,615
Yours only.

530
00:33:43,597 --> 00:33:45,579
We’ll get through this together.

531
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:49,469
Moo.

532
00:33:50,869 --> 00:33:51,627
Hmm?

533
00:33:52,871 --> 00:33:54,127
Can I ask you something?

534
00:33:56,434 --> 00:33:57,175
What is it?

535
00:33:59,897 --> 00:34:01,824
Between your dream and me,

536
00:34:04,573 --> 00:34:05,803
which comes first?

537
00:34:12,564 --> 00:34:13,622
Well,

538
00:34:16,318 --> 00:34:17,327
Let me answer it for you.

539
00:34:18,520 --> 00:34:19,752
Your dream comes first.

540
00:34:23,875 --> 00:34:24,800
Kang.

541
00:34:25,111 --> 00:34:27,158
You’re so close to making your dream come true.

542
00:34:28,843 --> 00:34:30,304
Don’t give it up because of me.

543
00:34:32,715 --> 00:34:33,606
Kang,

544
00:34:35,689 --> 00:34:36,748
is something wrong?

545
00:34:38,680 --> 00:34:39,665
Are you okay?

546
00:34:54,181 --> 00:34:55,215
Let’s break up.

547
00:34:55,708 --> 00:34:56,707
Let’s break up.

548
00:35:07,336 --> 00:35:08,404
No, I won’t break up with you.

549
00:35:09,571 --> 00:35:10,622
I won’t.

550
00:35:11,452 --> 00:35:12,885
You’re the one who told me

551
00:35:13,404 --> 00:35:15,633
we don’t have to choose between our dreams and love.

552
00:35:15,866 --> 00:35:17,762
We can have both at the same time, can’t we?

553
00:35:18,358 --> 00:35:21,211
The situation has changed, Moo.

554
00:35:22,922 --> 00:35:24,776
Back then, there was only me who loved you.

555
00:35:25,217 --> 00:35:29,161
